Mohite, in the order on November 26, 2025, ruled that the entire chain of evidence — from identification to recoveries — suffered from major legal and procedural lapses. The court acquitted the accused of charges under the Indian Penal Code and the MCOCA.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, eight unidentified men allegedly broke into the cable godown at Mankoli in Bhiwandi area of Maharashtra's Thane district on July 18, 2019, tied up the workers, and escaped with 64 bundles of polycab cable wire valued at ₹6.77 lakh along with cash and a driving licence. The intruders allegedly made a hole in the compound wall and broke the locks to gain entry.\n\nThe police later arrested seven persons in connection with the case. The court, however, found the testimonies of key eyewitnesses to be unreliable owing to contradictions and procedural violations.   \t The identification parade conducted at the Adharwadi Jail in Kalyan was also discarded.\n\n\"The prosecution has not recorded the evidence of Executive Magistrate...in these circumstances, it is unsafe to rely upon evidence of prosecution witness and test identification parade panchanama,\" the court said.\n\n\"The prosecution witnesses had seen the accused in the police station after their arrest...in these circumstances, it is unsafe to rely upon their testimony,\" the court said.\n\nThe court also rejected multiple recoveries, including cable bundles, sticks, knives and a tempo, on the ground that they were taken from open places, lacked corroboration, or witnesses contradicted police claims.\n\nThe prosecution produced call detail records of the accused to suggest coordination before and after the incident. But the court held that such data alone could not implicate them. The court also found that the prosecution completely failed to establish the statutory requirements of \"continuing unlawful activity\" and \"organised crime\".\n\n\"The mandatory requirement of the offence of organised crime as defined in Section 2(1)(e) of the MCOC Act has not been proved... mere collection of copies of previous charge sheets...are not sufficient to prove the offence,\" it said.\n\n\"Considering the evidence placed on record and the legal provisions of the MCOC Act, it is noted that the prosecution has failed to prove the involvement of the accused in the crime,\" the court said.\n\nThose acquitted in the case are Baitulla Ruabali Chaudhary (51), Kabir Usman Shaikh (48), Swapnil alias Gotya Rajendra Panchal (38), Bablu Jangbahadur Vishwakarma (44), Puran alias Kancha Sherbahadur Sonar (28), Deepak Jagat Vishwakarma (30) and Jamil Majid Khan (54).\n\nPublished - December 01, 2025 11:42 am IST\n\nMaharashtra / Mumbai / mumbai / crime / theft & burglary\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

During the probe, the Bureau detected a transaction of ₹10 crore between Gulati's companies and firms run by the Majithia family, public prosecutor Preet Inderpal Singh said.\n\nMr. Gulati was earlier questioned about the transaction, but he failed to give any satisfactory reply, Mr. Singh said.\n\nMr. Gulati was produced before a court in Mohali, which sent him to a six-day vigilance remand, special public prosecutor Ferry Sofat said.\n\nAn official spokesperson of the Vigilance Bureau said Mr. Majithia, who is presently lodged in the New Nabha jail in Patiala after his arrest in a disproportionate assets case, faces serious allegations of quid pro quo.\n\nAfter the Akalis came to power in Punjab in 2007, the liquor sector allegedly “faced capture by political interests”, he said in a statement.\n\nMr. Gulati's firms allegedly secured liquor licences at Mr. Majithia's instance from 2008 onward, the spokesperson claimed.\n\n“Mr. Gulati's firms allegedly paid ₹4.25 crore (2008-09) and ₹1.40 crore (2009-10) to Mr. Majithia's companies and family, funding a farmhouse at the Sainik Farms in Delhi and other family benefits,” the spokesperson said.\n\nIn 2014-15, another ₹5.49 crore flowed in the same way to repay loans for Majithia-linked group entities, he alleged.\n\nThe probe also revealed that these transactions were non-commercial in nature, unrelated to any legitimate business dealings, and routed in the form of unsecured fund transfers/layered advances without any business rationale or justification, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Vigilance Bureau arrested Mr. Majithia on June 25 in the disproportionate assets case allegedly involving the laundering of ₹540 crore of “drug money”.\n\nOn August 22, the Bureau filed a chargesheet in a Mohali court, which ran into more than 40,000 pages.\n\nIn the FIR registered against Mr. Majithia, the Bureau claimed that preliminary investigations revealed the laundering of more than ₹540 crore of “drug money” through several channels, allegedly facilitated by the Akali leader.\n\nThe FIR stemmed from an ongoing investigation by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Punjab Police into a 2021 drug case.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Majithia was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act based on a 2018 report of the anti-drug STF.\n\nMr. Majithia spent more than five months in Patiala jail before walking out of prison in August 2022 after the Punjab and Haryana High Court granted him bail.\n\nPublished - December 01, 2025 11:32 am IST\n\nPunjab / police / arrest / corruption & bribery\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Nothing is to come out of it”, he said.\n\nMr. Joseph said the “real issue” at the moment is the gold theft at Sabarimala. He alleged that the CPI(M) was “protecting and defending the thieves, even those who have been caught red-handed.”\n\nCongress Working Committee member Ramesh Chennithala also reiterated Mr. Joseph’s statement that the ED notice was part of an understanding. “We would welcome it if it is an honest investigation”, he added.\n\nPublished - December 01, 2025 11:21 am IST\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

These issues, she said, need to be addressed through proper discussion and effective solutions.\n\n“Merely trading allegations will not help,” the BSP supremo said, urging political parties to rise above self-interest.

VMRDA is undertaking this project to provide hassle-free road connectivity to the ASR Greenfield International Airport in Bhogapuram near Visakhapatnam. Photo: Special Arrangment\n\nWith the authorities gearing up for the ‘validation flight’ at the Greenfield International Airport at Bhogapuram in December to test and certify airport approach and departure procedures for aircraft, the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) has set a new deadline of May 2026 to complete the seven master plan road projects.\n\nThe seven-road project spanning 26.72 km requires coordination between the GVMC, Roads & Buildings, Panchayat Raj, Forests, and private landowners who have parted their stretches for the projects.\n\nAccording to sources, the road projects have slowed down due to land acquisition challenges, with the toughest hurdle being the acquisition of 75 acres.\n\nCompensation options include cash payments, alternative sites, and transferable development rights (TDRs). So far, only a few landowners have agreed to the compensation through TDRs.\n\nThe seven roads are being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs. 156 crore, including CSR funds from the corporate companies. These roads include: An 8 km road from Adivivaram BRTS junction to Gandigundam (Rs. 40 crore), awaiting forest clearance; a 2.2 km road from Anandapuram NH to Gambhiram Reservoir, a 1.7 km expansion from Shivashakti Nagar to the VUDA Haritha project (Rs. 7.65 crore); a 1.4 km expansion from Paradeshipalem to Gambhiram (Rs. 5.04 crore); a 3.83 km road from Nerallavalasa to Tallavalasa (Rs. 24 crore); a 3 km widening from Boyapalem Junction to Kapuluppada (Rs. 15 crore); widening of 6.32-km road from Chippada to Polipilli (Rs. 37.92 crore).\n\nThese roads are designed to ease traffic on the national highway and provide quicker access for passengers from Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, and Srikakulam districts to the new airport.\n\nFurther, plans are afoot to widen 15 internal roads for better connectivity at an estimated cost of Rs. 390 crore. A proposed six-lane beach corridor connecting Beach Road in Visakhapatnam to the airport is under development, with the Detailed Project Report (DPR) finalised.\n\nFour elevated corridors have also been proposed, linking the Aganampudi-Lankelapalem area to Kommadi.\n\nAccording to the information available with the VMRDA officials, private land must be acquired from 348 owners, who will be issued transferable development rights (TDR) bonds as compensation.\n\n“So far, we have issued 155 TDRs out of 348. We will clear the rest soon. Only vegetation clearance and initial foundation work have been completed. None of the road widenings is ready. Permission from the Forest Department is required for the patches in the middle of some roads. However, we are on the right track to complete the work within the deadline,” said a VMRDA official.\n\nSpeaking toThe Hindu, VMRDA Chairman M.V. Pranav Gopal said, “Despite the challenges, we are determined to complete these seven roads connecting Visakhapatnam and Bhogapuram airport before the domestic operations begin. We have set a deadline of May 2026 to complete the works.”\n\nOn the other hand, sources said that the airport’s progress is ahead of schedule, with 90% of the core building works completed. Around 97% of the runway works have been finished and 92% of the taxiways works have been completed. The ‘validation flight’ is scheduled for December, they said.\n\nA ‘validation flight’ is critical for testing and certifying airport approach and departure procedures for aircraft. It is essentially a test flight to ensure that the landing and departure procedures, infrastructure readiness, and navigational and communication systems for the new runway and airport comply with regulatory and safety standards.\n\nPublished - December 01, 2025 11:05 am IST\n\nroad transport / Visakhapatnam / Andhra Pradesh\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

But he could not attend the programme after his travel documentation and clearance were delayed.\n\nPAP is a travel document required by foreigners to visit certain sensitive areas in the country.\n\nMr. Rio had on November 18 and 28 written to the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, requesting early clearance of visas for foreign tourists, and urging that the PAP regime for Nagaland be lifted permanently, which was reimposed from December last year.\n\nThe CM said that although the Centre has relaxed the PAP requirement for Nagaland from December 1 to 10 to facilitate the Hornbill Festival, the temporary measure \"does not solve the larger issue\".\n\nHe said the state Cabinet reviewed the matter in January, and several representations were sent to the Centre since the re-imposition of PAP on December 17 for Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland.\n\n\"The State government will continue to pursue the matter for complete and permanent lifting of the PAP regime for Nagaland. Our state deserves to be treated differently, based on the reality on the ground,\" Mr. Rio asserted.\n\nWelcoming Rev Robert Cunville of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), Mr. Rio recalled the historic 1972 'Billy Graham Crusade' at Khuochiezie, which he had attended as a youth.\n\nHe lauded Mr. Cunville's long-standing Ministry in the Northeast and extended warm greetings to the visiting BGEA team, asking them to convey Nagaland’s goodwill to Franklin Graham.\n\nThe Chief Minister also appreciated the KBPF, NBCC and the Nagaland Joint Christian Forum for organising the programme.\n\nEmphasising unity, Mr. Rio urged citizens to uphold peace and coexistence, recalling how the gospel and education transformed Naga society from a history of conflict to a community anchored in faith and progress.\n\nAs the festive season approaches, he called for renewed commitment to brotherhood, harmony and fellowship.\n\nDelivering a powerful gospel message, Mr. Cunville urged believers to pause from the world and listen to God's voice.\n\nThousands of people from all age groups filled the stadium, joining in worship, prayer and reflection during the special revival service.\n\nPublished - December 01, 2025 10:55 am IST\n\nNagaland\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Thomas Isaac and KIIFB Chief Executive Officer K.M. Abraham also have received notices from the ED.\n\nKIIFB had raised around ₹2,150 crore through masala bond in March 2019, and listed it on the International Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange on April 1, 2019. The ED notice is related to the alleged use of the funds raised through the bonds to purchase land and alleged violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) norms.\n\nThe ED notice to the Chief Minister was reportedly issued a few days ago.\n\nResponding to the notice, Mr. Isaac described the notices as “politically motivated and a smokescreen.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday (December 1, 2025), he said the ED has regularly come up with the “masala bond issue” ahead of elections in Kerala, starting with the 2020 local body elections. He said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is responsible for giving clearances for masala bond and all actions were taken as per RBI approval.\n\nAccording to him, the ED has now filed its report before the Special Director, ED, (Adjudication), New Delhi, and the Chief Minister, himself and Mr. Abraham have been asked to explain before the adjudicator.\n\nMr. Isaac said that land was never purchased using the funds, but acquired. “Moreover, when acquiring, RBI had also taken away the condition that land cannot be purchased,” he said, adding that legal advice would be sought to finalise a response to the notice.\n\nMeanwhile, CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan termed the ED notice to the Chief Minister “a political game.” ED notices have coincided with elections in Kerala, he said.\n\n“ED has issued notices during the 2020 local body elections, the 202 Assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. It is a political game,” he said.\n\nBy issuing show-cause notices, the ED has thrown a challenge not to the Chief Minister or Mr. Isaac, but the people of Kerala. KIIFB has spearheaded development initiatives worth ₹1 lakh crore in the State, he said.\n\nPublished - December 01, 2025 10:21 am IST\n\nKerala\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

    "content": "Amid the ongoing power struggle in Karnataka, Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said all was well within the state unit of Congress and refuted claims of a difference of opinion between him and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Shivakumar said he is well aware of his “limits” as Karnataka Congress president. He also shared that the party's sole focus is to prepare a strategy for the 2028 Karnataka Assembly elections.\n\n“There is no difference between me and the CM. Being the party president, I know my limits. Nowhere have I made any comments or expressed a difference of opinion with the CM. We are all working together,” he said.\n\n“There are a lot of aspirations of the people of Karnataka, and we are committed to working for them,” he added.\n\nSharing Congress ' vision for the 2028 polls, Shivakumar said, “Our aim is 2028 and 2029, and we are working for it. The CM and I will work out a strategy.”\n\nHe said that the Karanataka CM duo want to call an all-party meeting on various issues.\n\nAlthough Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar aimed to send out a message of harmony, the opposition dismissed the meeting as a \"breakup par makeup\", alleging that the leaders were merely attempting to mask their internal differences with a show of solidarity.\n\nSpeculations about a leadership change in Karnataka rose on November 20, when the Siddaramaiah-led government completed its half-term.\n\nSiddaramaiah, the current CM, insists he'll complete his five-year term, citing the mandate given by the people of Karnataka. He's emphasised his commitment to fulfilling the party's promises, including the five guarantee schemes.\n\nShivakumar, on the other hand, is pushing for a leadership change, citing a \"secret agreement\" among senior leaders that he should take over as CM after 2.5 years.\n\nThe high command, led by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, is expected to make a decision soon. Both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar have expressed willingness to abide by the party's decision.\n\nThe tussle, fueled by the 2023 \"power-sharing agreement\" between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, has pushed each side's loyalists to lobby for their leaders' claims to the state's top post.\n\n(With ANI inputs)\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "content": "By Tarek Amara\n\nTUNIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Tunisian police arrested prominent opposition figure Chaima Issa at a protest in the capital Tunis on Saturday to enforce a 20-year prison sentence, her lawyers said.\n\nAn appeals court handed jail terms of up to 45 years to opposition leaders, business leaders and lawyers on Friday on charges of conspiracy to overthrow President Kais Saied, in what critics said was a sign of increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nDuring the protest, just before Issa's arrest, she and two of the other convicted politicians called for the fractured opposition to unite and escalate demonstrations against Saied.\n\n\"They will arrest me shortly,\" Issa told Reuters. \"I say to the Tunisians, continue to protest and reject tyranny. We are sacrificing our freedom for you\".\n\nShe described the charges as unjust and politically motivated.\n\nMORE ARRESTS ARE EXPECTED\n\nPolice are also widely expected to arrest Najib Chebbi, the head of the opposition National Salvation Front, the main coalition challenging Saied.\n\n\"We will not gain freedom except by unity,\" Chebbi, who got a 12-year prison sentence, told Reuters at the rally.\n\n\"We are ready for prison, we are not afraid,\" said opposition figure Ayachi Hammami, who got a five-year sentence. \"I hope that the youth will expand protests until the authorities reconsider, or else be swept away by the will of the people.\"\n\nSaied says he is fighting traitors, corrupt figures and mercenaries. He accuses civil society groups of receiving foreign funding with the aim of interfering in Tunisian affairs.\n\nForty people were charged in the case, one of the largest political prosecutions in Tunisia's recent history. Twenty of those charged have fled abroad and were sentenced in absentia.\n\nThe sentences ranged from five to 45 years, according to a court document seen by Reuters.\n\nRights groups said the ruling was an escalation of Saied's crackdown on dissent since he seized extraordinary powers in 2021. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called for the immediate annulment of the sentences.\n\nCritics, journalists and activists have been jailed and independent NGOs suspended.\n\n(Reporting By Tarek Amara; Editing by Toby Chopra, Timothy Heritage and Andrew Heavens)\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "content": "In a blow to the Aam Aadmi Party ahead of the MCD bypolls, senior leader and former two-time MLA Rajesh Gupta switched to the BJP on Saturday. Gupta, who had also served as AAP's national spokesperson and headed its Karnataka unit, joined the BJP in the presence of Delhi state president Virendra Sachdeva.\n\nSachdeva welcomed Gupta into the BJP fold by offering him the party's stole, said a statement released by the Delhi BJP.\n\nThe Delhi BJP president said that the AAP leaders were now listing shortcomings and problems in Delhi that were all created during the 12-year rule of their party, and yet they were questioning an eight-month-old government of the BJP.\n\nGupta alleged that the “biggest reason” behind the “downfall” of the AAP and its leader, Arvind Kejriwal , was treating workers in a “use and throw” manner.\n\nAccording to the statement, “While joining the BJP, Rajesh Gupta became emotional as he recalled his contributions to AAP, the mockery he received in return, and the behaviour of AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal. He even broke down in tears.”\n\nWhen AAP was founded, many prominent individuals enthusiastically joined hands with Arvind Kejriwal, but he “betrayed everyone”, and one by one, they all chose to leave him, Gupta said in the statement.\n\n“Today, unfortunately, I have also joined that list,” he added.\n\nHe claimed that in the Ashok Vihar ward, AAP has given a ticket to a person for the bypoll who has been issued a notice by the party itself.\n\nHe further said, \"Despite my years of sincerity, honesty and loyalty, when I raised concerns, the party president wasn't even ready to talk to me. This is the situation when the party is neither in power in the Delhi government nor in the MCD.\n\nTreating workers as 'use and throw' is the biggest reason behind Arvind Kejriwal and AAP's decline,\" Gupta claimed.\n\nThe Delhi BJP chief said that Rajesh Gupta had created a distinct identity for himself as a responsible MLA, but Arvind Kejriwal failed to value that identity. He added that the way Kejriwal is missing from Delhi after losing the Assembly polls and the circumstances under which he left demand close examination.\n\nSachdeva said that with Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia missing entirely, AAP leaders Atishi and Gopal Rai are merely making \"special appearances\" in Delhi, referring to campaigning for bypolls to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "content": "Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Saturday asserted that there are no differences between the two senior leaders of Congress and agenda is 2028 amid power tussle in Karnataka's political landscape. Siddaramaiah had invited Deputy CM DK Shivakumar for breakfast to his Cauvery residence to discuss certain concerning issues amid power-struggle for CM post.\n\nHe said, “The breakfast was good. We didn't talk about anything there. We just had breakfast. DKS came to our house today...DKS invited me to his house.”\n\nEmphasising that upcoming 2028 Assembly elections are on agenda, he stated, \"There are no differences between us and there will be no differences in the future,\" ANI reported.\n\n“Our agenda is the 2028 elections. Local body elections are important. We discussed them. We also discussed bringing back Congress in the 2028 elections. We discussed that we will go together. There are no differences between us and there will be no differences in the future, ” ANI quoted Siddaramaiah as saying.\n\nAlleging that BJP and JDS are making false allegations, he added, \"The BJP and JDS have a habit of making false allegations. The BJP and JDS have made statements that they will bring a no-confidence motion. They are only 60, and the JDS is 18. They cannot match our numbers. We are 140. This is a futile exercise . We will confront their false allegations.\"\n\nAsserting that there is no confusion, he further noted, “We have decided that we will follow whatever the high command says. There will be no confusion from tomorrow. There is still no confusion. Some media reporters have created the confusion.”\n\nDuring the much-anticipated breakfast meeting, Siddaramaiah urged DK Shivakumar to take over the chief minister post after the next Assembly elections in the state in 2028, Hindustan Times reported citing sources. Amid speculation over leadership change in the state, both leaders stuck to their positions during the meeting.\n\nThe contentious issue surfaced after Siddaramaiah-led state government completed two-and-a-half years in power on November 20. Notably, Siddaramaiah assumed the CM post back in 2023 and a “rotational CM arrangement” or “power-sharing deal” was reportedly agreed upon according to which the chief minister was apparently supposed to relinquish his post to his deputy after completion of half tenure.\n\nAs per this “secret deal” anchored by the Congress leadership, DK Shivakumar was supposed to take over the CM role after Siddaramaiah completed half of his tenure. Amid the buzz over a possible leadership change, Siddaramaiah tried to settle matters following orders of high command to discuss the issue. Hence, he invited his deputy over for breakfast this morning ahead of commencement of winter session of Parliament from 1 December.\n\nFollowing the significant meeting, DK Shivakumar in a post on X wrote, “Met Hon’ble CM Shri @siddaramaiah avaru at Cauvery Residence this morning for a breakfast meeting.

The chief minister's legal advisor AS Ponnanna was also present during the breakfast between the two leaders.\n\nAfter the meeting , Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar took to their social media handles. Siddaramaiah said, “Had breakfast with Deputy Chief Minister D.K.

    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Peruvian President José Jerí said he is pushing ahead with plans to declare a state of emergency as migrants block the country’s southern border with Chile, from where undocumented foreigners are apparently fleeing ahead of a threatened crackdown on migration.\n\n“Our borders must be respected,” Jerí said in an X post on Friday. “An extraordinary Cabinet meeting is being convened to declare, as previously announced, a state of emergency and thus reinforce surveillance efforts with the Armed Forces.”\n\nJerí added that immigration and police authorities will step up identity checks to ensure public safety, a move that follows rising political tensions as migrants leaving Chile for Peru prompt fears of a broader exodus.\n\nAccording to Peruvian TV channel Canal N, dozens of undocumented migrants blocked the Tacna–Arica border crossing between Peru and Chile on Friday. The group demanded entry into Peru to travel on to their home countries, saying they were leaving Chile because of increasingly strict immigration policies, the outlet reported.\n\nThe disruption created lengthy traffic delays on both sides of the frontier.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the regional governor of Tacna, Luis Torres, told RPP Noticias that there were between 70 and 80 Venezuelans stranded on the Chilean side of the border.\n\n“They’ve even blocked the road — they’re not letting cars, trucks, or anything pass,” Torres said.\n\nChile’s leading presidential candidate, arch-conservative José Antonio Kast, recently visited the country’s border area and warned undocumented migrants to leave or face expulsion, prompting some to head north. The shift quickly drew attention in Peru, where Jerí announced plans for a state of emergency, which allows the military to assume some police functions and suspends certain civil liberties such as the right to assembly.\n\nAs Chile heads into a Dec. 14 runoff between Kast and communist rival Jeannette Jara, the country’s migration policies have taken center stage.

    "link": "https://www.livemint.com/politics/siddaramaiah-shivakumar-truce-attempt-karnataka-cm-invites-deputy-for-breakfast-crisis-talks-as-cong-banks-on-timing-11764348429561.html",
    "content": "In a significant development amid an escalating leadership tussle in Karnataka, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday invited his deputy DK Shivakumar for a breakfast meeting on Saturday, following clear instructions from the Congress high command to hold direct talks. The move comes as the party attempts to defuse intensifying internal tensions, even as senior leaders publicly insist that the Congress “has the sense of timing” to intervene at the right moment.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Siddaramaiah confirmed that the party’s central leadership had asked both leaders to meet.\n\n“The party high command had called me and him (D K Shivkumar) and asked us to have a meeting. Hence, I have invited him for breakfast tomorrow. We will discuss when he comes.”\n\nHe was categorical that there had been “no change in my stand”, adding: “Both of us have said that we will obey whatever the party high command says.”\n\nSiddaramaiah also reiterated that he would travel to Delhi if asked:\n\n“I will go to Delhi if the high command calls me.”\n\nShivakumar, who serves as both deputy chief minister and state Congress president, struck a conciliatory yet cautious tone.\n\n“I don’t want anything. I am not in a hurry. My party will take a decision.”\n\nHe confirmed he may travel to the national capital ahead of the Parliament’s winter session beginning 1 December:\n\n“I have a lot of work there… I have to meet all Karnataka MPs because they need to take up some of our projects.”\n\nWhen asked whether he would meet the high command, he responded emphatically:\n\n“Delhi is our temple. All of us have to go. Without Delhi, nothing can happen. Congress is a party with a long history, and it has always guided us.”\n\nWhat is the Congress high command’s calculation?\n\nIn comments that drew attention, minister Priyank Kharge , son of national Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, said the leadership in Delhi would intervene at the appropriate moment.\n\n“The high command has the sense of timing. It will take a call, keeping in mind the right time.”\n\nHe urged the media and public not to speculate further, saying any decision would be announced only after an invitation from Delhi.\n\nAmid growing conjecture over whether Congress had promised a mid-term rotation of the chief ministership, Siddaramaiah’s son Yathindra dismissed suggestions of internal rebellion.\n\n“There is no battle or skirmish… Since there is no confusion amongst us, I feel the media is into perception creation.”\n\nOn the reported two-and-a-half-year power-sharing formula, he said:\n\n“No one knows whether any promise was made about leadership change after two-and-half years… So, it is not proper to speculate about it.”\n\nHe added that discussions about MLAs’ preferences should remain inside the party.\n\nThe BJP has sharpened its attack ahead of the Belagavi legislature session. Former chief minister and MP Basavaraj Bommai hinted at possible parliamentary action:\n\n“There is time till December 8. If such a situation arises, the occasion to move a no-confidence motion may come.”\n\nSaturday’s breakfast meeting between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar is expected to be the first direct conversation after weeks of political rumblings over leadership. With the Congress high command poised to intervene only when it believes the moment is strategically right, the state’s political landscape remains fluid — and the outcome of this internal negotiation could shape Karnataka’s governance trajectory well into the 2026 election cycle.\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "content": "A Trinamool Congress delegation on Friday met with the full bench of the Election Commission of India here and alleged that around 40 SIR-related deaths had occurred in West Bengal so far, accusing the poll panel chief of having \"blood on his hands\".\n\nThe 10-member delegation, led by TMC Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien, met the EC officials amid the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal.\n\nThe delegation consisted of Lok Sabha MPs Mahua Moitra, Satabdi Roy, Kalyan Banerjee, Pratima Mondal, Sajda Ahmed, and Rajya Sabha MPs Dola Sen, Mamata Thakur, Saket Gokhale, and Prakash Chik Barik.\n\nFollowing their meeting, O'Brien addressed reporters, saying that the party had raised five questions, but Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar did not respond to any of them.\n\n\"We started the meeting by stating that the CEC has blood on his hands. We raised five questions. After this, Kalyan Banerjee, Mahua Moitra, and Mamata Thakur spoke and shared whatever they had to in about 40 minutes,\" O'Brien said.\n\n\"Then the CEC spoke uninterrupted for one hour. We were also not interrupted while we spoke, but we did not receive any answer to any of our five questions,\" he added.\n\nMoitra said the delegation shared with the CEC a list of 40 people whose deaths, they alleged, were linked to the SIR exercise. The commission, however, dismissed it as mere allegations, the Lok Sabha MP claimed.\n\n\"We started with giving them a list of persons whose deaths are linked to the SIR process... The CEC said these are merely allegations...\" Moitra said.\n\nThe TMC MPs asked the poll body about the claim that the exercise would weed out non-voters, and questioned why the exercise was not being undertaken in the Northeastern states, which also face the risk of infiltration as they share borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar.\n\nThey also questioned how the electoral roll, on which the last Lok Sabha election was held, suddenly became \"unreliable\". The MPs raised the issues of alleged deaths linked to the SIR process, and questioned who would take responsibility for it. Additionally, they expressed worries about the neutrality and effectiveness of the SIR process and noted a recent amendment in the rules by the poll panel that allows for the appointment of external Booth Level Agents (BLAs).\n\nThe TMC further informed the CEC that BJP leaders in West Bengal are claiming that one crore voters' names will be deleted. \"The ECI has taken no cognisance of these comments, nor have they negated the dear mongering by the BJP,\" a TMC leader said.\n\nA party source said they have compiled a list of 60 tragedies linked to SIR - 41 common people and 19 BLOs. Of the common individuals, 35 have died, and six are receiving medical attention. Among the 19 BLOs affected, four have died, while 15 are hospitalised or receiving care.\n\nThe SIR is currently underway in 12 states and Union territories, including West Bengal.\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "link": "https://www.livemint.com/politics/sir-in-bengal-tmc-questions-real-purpose-of-voter-revision-asks-if-it-meant-to-cast-doubt-on-bengali-identity-blo-death-11764322072248.html",
    "content": "SIR in Bengal: A 10-member delegation of Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) MPs met Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Friday, sharply challenging the rationale, neutrality and execution of the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal. The party alleged that the process has turned “punitive”, disproportionately targets Bengalis, and has already resulted in deaths of several Booth Level Officers (BLOs), prompting the delegation to accuse the Election Commission of India (ECI) of having “blood on their hands”.\n\nTMC MP Derek O’Brien said after the meeting, “10 MPs from the All India Trinamool Congress met with the Chief Election Commissioner Mr Kumar and his team. We first handed over to him a list of almost 40 dead because of the SIR process. We started the meeting by telling him that Mr Kumar and the Election Commission of India have blood on their hands.”\n\nOther TMC MPs present included Dola Sena, Saket Gokhale, Mamata Thakur and Mahua Moitra.\n\nTMC's memorandum questioned why West Bengal alone was facing an extensive SIR, while other border states were exempt.\n\nThe delegation stated: “The SIR's real purpose now feels deeply questionable . Is it meant to verify voters, or to cast doubt on the very identity of Bengalis? If infiltration is the issue, why are states like Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur bordering Bangladesh and Myanmar left out of the process?\"\n\n\"Even in Assam, you failed to institute the SIR, instead choosing an eyewash by the name of ‘Special Revision’. Only Bengal is being singled out. So we ask again: Was the SIR meant to protect the voter list or to quietly push Bengalis out of it?” the TMC questioned.\n\nThe Election Commission is currently conducting the SIR across a wide set of states and Union Territories, including West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, as well as the Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Puducherry.\n\nThe TMC further pointed out that the same electoral rolls currently under scrutiny were relied upon during major national and state elections in the past year.\n\nThe memorandum asks:\n\n“The same electoral rolls that the ECI now questions were good enough to elect the country's Lok Sabha just last year. Three major Assembly Elections have taken place since. Families stood in long queues believing their democratic rights were protected. How did those rolls suddenly become ‘unreliable’ within a year? And if the rolls really are unreliable then why not dissolve the Lok Sabha that was elected by these ‘unreliable voters’?”\n\nThe 2024 Lok Sabha elections delivered a return to power for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though the party fell short of the 272-seat majority on its own — winning 240 seats.\n\nWith its allies, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured enough support to form the new government, maintaining continuity at the Centre.\n\nIn West Bengal, the TMC emerged as the clear winner, claiming 29 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats.\n\nA central focus of TMC’s complaint was the reported deaths of Booth Level Officers across states during the SIR exercise.\n\nThey argued: “Across several states in India, numerous BLOs have lost their lives while carrying out their SIR duties. In several cases, BLOs have been forced to commit suicide, citing the inhuman pressure by the ECI, and in other cases, families have revealed that the BLOs were forced to work under inhuman conditions that resulted in health failures and finally their untimely deaths. Who will take responsibility for these lives lost? The Election Commission or Chief Election Commissioner Mr Gyanesh Kumar?”\n\nThe TMC alleged inadequate training, unrealistic deadlines, and systemic pressure that amounted to institutional neglect: “We have seen how the BLOs received insufficient training, next to no support, were piled down with unrealistic deadlines and pressured until many of them finally succumbed to illness or death. Is the blood of these avoidable deaths not on the Chief Electoral Commissioners’ hands?”\n\nAround 40 Booth Level Officers in West Bengal have tragically lost their lives during the ongoing revision exercise, with families citing intense pressure and inadequate institutional support as contributing factors.\n\nThe TMC also accused the ECI of selective responsiveness, suggesting it reacts swiftly to concerns raised by the BJP but ignores those brought forward by the Opposition.\n\nThey stated: “The Trinamool Congress has raised questions about the neutrality and efficacy of the SIR process time and time again; yet the Election Commission has not taken any concrete steps to address our concerns. Yet, when the BJP raises a frivolous issue, it is taken up with utmost priority… Does this not reek of bias and partisan practice, which you seek to address, ultimately to the detriment of your constitutional autonomy?”\n\nThe TMC cited decisions on external Booth Level Agents (BLAs) and exclusions of data-entry operators from Bangla Sahayata Kendras as examples that “reveal bias”.\n\nThe TMC delegation also pointed to evolving rules and narratives around electoral procedures in other states, alleging that these changes appear politically convenient for the BJP.\n\nTheir statement added: “In Bihar, we saw how suddenly the Model Code of Conduct became malleable with new restrictions on public mobilisation, spending and new provisions of digital complaints all geared to aid the BJP. In Bengal, BJP leaders are claiming that ~1 Cr voters' names will be deleted from the rolls. The ECI has taken no cognizance of these comments, nor have they negated the fear mongering by the BJP. That leads us to ask two questions, is the ECI working upon command of the BJP? Is every sacrosanct provision now tamperable to suit a single political party's agenda?”\n\nThe SIR in West Bengal commenced on 4 November 2025, when enumeration forms started being distributed to voters across the state.\n\nAs of late November, roughly 3.8 crore out of 7.6 crore voters’ forms have been digitised — about 49.3% of the total.\n\nThe process of form submission and digitisation is scheduled to continue until 4 December 2025, with the draft electoral rolls expected to be published on 9 December 2025 and the final voter list due on 7 February 2026.\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

    "content": "Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar has once again dismissed speculation about discussions regarding a change in leadership in the state, asserting that he is \"not in a hurry for anything\" and has not held any talks with senior Congress leaders about the post of Chief Minister.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Mumbai, Shivakumar categorically denied meeting Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge or Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi during his visit to the city.\n\n\"I have come for a family function. There was no meeting or anything. Why would I come to a meeting in Mumbai? If there has to be a meeting, it will be in Bangalore or Delhi,\" he said.\n\nResponding to questions about whether he had raised the issue of the Karnataka Chief Minister's post with the party leadership, the Deputy Chief Minister said, \"No... I am not in a hurry for anything.\"\n\nShivakumar's remarks come amid growing speculation about a change in the Chief Ministerial face of Karnataka, fueled by the \"power-sharing agreement\" of 2023 between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, which has been cited frequently in political circles.\n\nCongress MLC and son of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Yathindra Siddaramaiah, on Thursday backed his father, CM Siddaramaiah, for the Chief Ministerial post, saying he is unaware of any \"power sharing agreement\" between Siddaramaiah and state Deputy CM DK Shivakumar.\n\nYathindra expressed amazement over the discussion on the leadership change, asserting that \"there's no need to change the CM\". However, he clarified that the high command's decision on the issue will be final.\n\n\"In my opinion, there's no need to change the CM. Siddaramaiah will remain the full-time CM. I don't know why the issue of leadership change is being discussed repeatedly. I don't know if there was any discussion on power sharing before...the high command's decision is final,\" he said to the reporters.\n\n\"No one told me about power sharing. This isn't the first time MLAs have gone to Delhi to lobby. This has happened before in different parties. We stand by the high command's words. There's no need for change. There shouldn't have been any unnecessary changes. I personally say that Siddaramaiah will remain the CM for five years. The high command will review everything and decide what's best,\" he added.\n\nA day earlier, Deputy CM DK Shivakumar said that he and Chief Minister Siddaramiah will travel to Delhi if the party's leadership asks them to do so.\n\nIf the High Command asks me and the CM to come to Delhi, we will go,\" Shivakumar told reporters at Vidhana Soudha.\n\nOn Thursday, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge stated that a decision regarding leadership will be made after a discussion among the party's central leaders, excluding Siddaramiah and Shivakumar.\n\n\"I will call everyone and have a discussion. Rahul Gandhi will also remain present in that discussion. Other members will also remain present. CM and Dy CM will also remain present. The decision will be made after a discussion. There is a team. I am not alone. The entire high command team will discuss and make a decision,\" he told reporters.\n\n(With ANI inputs)\n\nCatch all the Business News , Politics news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.\n\nThe government will take up real estate-focused bankruptcy reforms separately, keeping them out of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) amendments likely to be introduced in Parliament either during the Winter Session starting today or in the budget session, two people aware of the matter said.\n\nThe decision means structural reforms aimed at protecting homebuyers and resolving stuck housing projects — a major stress point in India’s insolvency ecosystem — will wait longer. These measures were expected to address delays and low recovery rates in realty bankruptcies.\n\nFocus on ongoing Bill The ministry of corporate affairs is prioritizing insolvency law amendments that are already in an advanced stage, while real estate-focused reforms will undergo further expert and inter-ministerial consultations before being taken up separately, the people cited above said, requesting anonymity. The IBC (Amendments) Bill, 2025—currently under review by a Lok Sabha select committee headed by BJP MP Baijayant Panda—proposes a creditor-led, largely out-of-court insolvency process for quicker corporate turnaround, faster tribunal admissions, a new framework for group and cross-border bankruptcies, and separate provisions to resolve implementation disputes. Also Read | FM to introduce Bill for a new cess on Monday as tobacco levy set to wind down The Bill also proposed tighter definition of secured debt to exclude statutory dues that are not backed by an agreement and are created by mere operation of law. Considerable deliberations have already taken place within government on the proposed changes, and the Bill will not be held back to include real estate measures, the officials said. “Chances of the revised IBC (Amendments) Bill making it to either this or the budget session are fifty-fifty,\" one of the two officials said. Although the Bill is part of the winter legislative agenda, the committee’s review is still underway. It is scheduled to consult real estate regulatory authorities on 5 December and may receive more time to finalise its report, originally due “by the first day of the winter session\". The government is expected to modify the Bill based on these recommendations. Also Read | Slow, difficult recovery from dubious pre-bankruptcy deals Real estate fix later Reforms being weighed separately include project-specific insolvency, safeguards for homebuyers, enabling the SWAMIH fund to complete projects under IBC, and early project registration with local authorities. These deliberations involve the corporate affairs ministry, housing ministry and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). The proposals stem from the Supreme Court’s 12 September directions in the Mansi Brar Fernandes vs. Shubha Sharma case and remain at a preliminary stage. Two committees — one being set up by the government and another under IBBI — will finalise them before a later round of IBC amendments, said the second person. Investor confidence growing Experts say the bankruptcy code has already significantly strengthened the distressed-asset ecosystem. “India’s distressed-asset market has become significantly more investor-friendly in recent years. A more mature IBC framework, greater participation from asset reconstruction companies and alternative investment funds and enhanced transparency in resolution processes have collectively strengthened confidence,\" said Amit Maheshwari, tax partner, AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm. Also Read | How new IBC rules could speed up Videocon-like bankruptcy cases “IBC itself has evolved considerably with streamlined admission norms, stronger creditor rights and clearer claim rankings, smoother approval of resolution plans and consistent respect for the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors (CoC). Today, investors have a far better visibility of timelines, rights, and recovery pathways than in the Code’s early years,\" said Maheshwari. Queries emailed to the ministry of corporate affairs, ministry of housing and urban affairs, and IBBI remained unanswered. Maheshwari added that the roll out of a simplified pre-packaged insolvency framework for MSMEs in 2020 has further paved the way for quicker revival of smaller stressed businesses. “In real estate, these reforms reduce execution risk, preserve value, and enable structured acquisitions which makes investing in distressed-asset more feasible for long-term capital,\" Maheshwari said. Measures such as strict enforcement of debt resolution timelines, expansion of NCLT capacity, dedicated sector-specific resolution schemes and a cross-border framework will make the IBC regime more refined, said experts.\n\nThe ministry of corporate affairs is prioritizing insolvency law amendments that are already in an advanced stage, while real estate-focused reforms will undergo further expert and inter-ministerial consultations before being taken up separately, the people cited above said, requesting anonymity.\n\nThe IBC (Amendments) Bill, 2025—currently under review by a Lok Sabha select committee headed by BJP MP Baijayant Panda—proposes a creditor-led, largely out-of-court insolvency process for quicker corporate turnaround, faster tribunal admissions, a new framework for group and cross-border bankruptcies, and separate provisions to resolve implementation disputes.\n\nThe Bill also proposed tighter definition of secured debt to exclude statutory dues that are not backed by an agreement and are created by mere operation of law.\n\nConsiderable deliberations have already taken place within government on the proposed changes, and the Bill will not be held back to include real estate measures, the officials said.\n\n“Chances of the revised IBC (Amendments) Bill making it to either this or the budget session are fifty-fifty,\" one of the two officials said.\n\nAlthough the Bill is part of the winter legislative agenda, the committee’s review is still underway.

Also Read | How new IBC rules could speed up Videocon-like bankruptcy cases “IBC itself has evolved considerably with streamlined admission norms, stronger creditor rights and clearer claim rankings, smoother approval of resolution plans and consistent respect for the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors (CoC). Today, investors have a far better visibility of timelines, rights, and recovery pathways than in the Code’s early years,\" said Maheshwari. Queries emailed to the ministry of corporate affairs, ministry of housing and urban affairs, and IBBI remained unanswered. Maheshwari added that the roll out of a simplified pre-packaged insolvency framework for MSMEs in 2020 has further paved the way for quicker revival of smaller stressed businesses. “In real estate, these reforms reduce execution risk, preserve value, and enable structured acquisitions which makes investing in distressed-asset more feasible for long-term capital,\" Maheshwari said. Measures such as strict enforcement of debt resolution timelines, expansion of NCLT capacity, dedicated sector-specific resolution schemes and a cross-border framework will make the IBC regime more refined, said experts.\n\nReforms being weighed separately include project-specific insolvency, safeguards for homebuyers, enabling the SWAMIH fund to complete projects under IBC, and early project registration with local authorities. These deliberations involve the corporate affairs ministry, housing ministry and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).\n\nThe proposals stem from the Supreme Court’s 12 September directions in the Mansi Brar Fernandes vs. Shubha Sharma case and remain at a preliminary stage. Two committees — one being set up by the government and another under IBBI — will finalise them before a later round of IBC amendments, said the second person.\n\nInvestor confidence growing Experts say the bankruptcy code has already significantly strengthened the distressed-asset ecosystem. “India’s distressed-asset market has become significantly more investor-friendly in recent years.

    "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took a jibe at the Opposition by urging it to focus on positivity and delivery and avoid doing ‘drama’ during Parliament sessions. The prime minister insisted that the ‘panic’ of defeat or ‘arrogance’ of victory should not become a ground for debate during Parliament sessions.\n\n\"I urge all parties, in this winter session, that the panic of defeat should not become a ground for debate. As public representatives, we should handle the responsibility and expectations of the people of the country with utmost balance and responsibility, while thinking about the future,\" PM Modi said, speaking ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament beginning today, 1 December.\n\n“This session should focus on what this Parliament thinks about the country, what it wants to do for the country. The focus should be on these issues. The opposition should also fulfill its responsibility,” Modi said.\n\nThe Winter Session will continue till 19 December. The session is likely to kick off on a stormy note, with the Opposition insisting on a debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by the Election Commission of India, which is underway in many states across the country.\n\nThe government, which plans to introduce 13 bills during the session, has expressed its willingness to discuss any issue in accordance with the rules.

They should overcome the disappointment of defeat. And unfortunately, there are some parties that are unable to digest the defeat.

But from what I heard yesterday, it seems that defeat has troubled them,” PM Modi said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also said this winter session isn't just a ritual. \"India has lived democracy.

    "content": "Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has shared his perspective on charity and philanthropy, describing the art of giving as “very hard” and full of challenges.\n\nIn an interview with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on his WTF Podcast, Musk said that while philanthropy is necessary to help fellow humans, it's not an easy job.\n\nHe was responding to a question from Nikhil Kamath, who inquired about his views on philanthropy and charity.\n\n“I think we should. I agree with the love of humanity, and we should definitely strive to do things that help our fellow human beings. But it’s very hard,” he said on the WTF Podcast, which was released on YouTube on Sunday.\n\nThe Tesla CEO, whose net worth has remained above $400 billion for some time now, explained why it is challenging to give away money in real life.\n\n“If you care about the reality of goodness rather than simply the perception of it, it’s extremely difficult to give away money well,” he said.\n\nTalking about the Musk Foundation, the Tesla CEO told Nikhil Kamath on the WTF Podcast that the biggest challenge for the charity is to give the money away in a way that actually benefits people.\n\n“I have a large foundation, but I don’t put my name on it. In fact, I’ve said I don’t want my name on anything. The biggest challenge I find with the foundation is trying to give money away in a way that is truly beneficial to people,” Elon Musk said.\n\n“It’s very easy to give money away in a way that creates the appearance of goodness. It is very difficult—extremely difficult—to give money away for the reality of goodness,” he added.\n\nMusk has in the past been sceptical about donating money as well.\n\n“I think if you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it, philanthropy is extremely difficult,” he told Chris Anderson in 2022.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg in November this year, Elon Musk donated a record $474 million to charity in 2024. The vast majority of the donations went to the entities controlled by him.\n\nAbout $370 million in funds of the Musk Foundation, Elon Musk's charity, went to Foundation, a nonprofit set up by the Tesla CEO to establish a STEM-focused primary and secondary school, according to tax filings cited by Bloomberg .\n\nA donor-advised fund at Fidelity Charitable received another $35 million, while the remaining money went to a host of other nonprofit organisations, including groups working in areas like healthcare, disaster relief and education.\n\nStay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.\n\nDownload the Mint app and read premium stories\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

    "content": "A day before the Winter Session of Parliament begins, the government on Sunday, November 30, convened an all-party meeting at Parliament House Annexe, chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, with 50 leaders from 36 political parties in attendance.\n\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said the discussions were held in a “positive atmosphere” and that the government has sought cooperation from all parties to ensure the smooth functioning of both Houses.\n\nHe said 14 legislative and other business items are tentatively listed for the session, adding that the government is ready to take up any important issue under the rules of Parliament.\n\nBut the Opposition signalled a stormy session, demanding a full debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and warning that Parliament’s functioning could be disrupted if the discussion is denied.\n\nSeveral Opposition leaders also pushed for an urgent debate on national security following the recent Delhi blast, as well as issues such as air pollution, farmers’ concerns, economic security and foreign policy.\n\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh called the all-party meeting a “mere formality,” alleging that the government has listed a subject for short-duration discussion “without any consultation with the Opposition.”\n\nHe criticised the short 15-day session—one of the briefest in parliamentary history—and noted that of the 13 Bills listed for passage, “ten have not been examined by the Standing Committee concerned.” He also suggested that the government may introduce additional Bills late in the session.\n\nCongress MP Gaurav Gogoi accused the government of attempting to “finish off democracy” and “bury parliamentary traditions,” claiming the ruling party does not want substantive discussions on national security or concerns related to the Election Commission and voter list purity. He said the Opposition demanded debates on security, pollution, farmers’ issues and foreign policy.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party took a hard line, with MP Ram Gopal Yadav asserting that the party “will not allow the House to function” if SIR is not taken up for discussion.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress also pressed for debate on SIR, MGNREGA, national security and air pollution. TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee, joined by MP Derek O’Brien, said 40 booth-level officers have reportedly died during the SIR exercise and alleged that the process should not be used to delete names.\n\nHe criticised the government for not allowing earlier discussions raised by the Opposition, questioning the Speaker’s statement that “the government was not willing.”\n\nDMK MP Tiruchi Siva said SIR was the “common issue for the Opposition,” while CPI MP P. Sandosh Kumar reiterated the demand for debates on national security, alleged irregularities in SIR and rising pollution levels.\n\nSenior ministers, including Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha J.P. Nadda, Ministers of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal and L. Murugan, also attended the meeting.\n\nThe Winter Session begins Monday and will run till December 19, with 15 sittings over 19 days.\n\nKey bills likely to be taken up during the winter session of 2025\n\nLegislative Business:\n\nJan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025\n\nInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n\nManipur Goods and Services Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 2025 (to replace Ordinance)\n\nRepealing and Amending Bill, 2025\n\nNational Highways (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n\nAtomic Energy Bill, 2025\n\nCorporate Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n\nSecurities Markets Code (SMC) Bill, 2025\n\nInsurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n\nHigher Education Commission of India Bill, 2025\n\nCentral Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n\nHealth Security se National Security Cess Bill, 2025\n\nFinancial Business:\n\nPresentation, discussion and voting on the First Batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants 2025–26 and passage of the related Appropriation Bill.\n\nNews\n\nLive TV\n\nMarket\n\nPopular Categories\n\nCalculators\n\nTrending Now\n\nLet's Connect with CNBCTV 18\n\nNetwork 18 Group :\n\n©TV18 Broadcast Limited.

    "content": "India’s economic activity strengthened further in the September quarter, with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) saying the 8.2% Q2 GDP growth reflects broad-based expansion across manufacturing, services and investment.\n\nMoSPI Secretary said the quarterly estimates were prepared using “700 indicators” and “100-odd sectoral and item-specific deflators,” noting that lower inflation was being faced by both consumers and producers.\n\nOnly mining and quarrying showed deceleration due to an extended monsoon impact, while services grew 9.2%, bank credit 10.2%, IT 11.5%, and the government sector 9.7%. Gross fixed capital formation rose 7.3%, maintaining a 30% share of GDP.\n\nCEA: H1 growth near 8%, FY26 to be ‘north of 7%’\n\nChief Economic Adviser Anantha Nageswaran said the 8.2% print was “outside most of the optimistic projections,” adding that supply-side investments over recent years were beginning to show results. Rural demand, he said, remains “very resilient”, while urban consumption is gaining traction as GST rate rationalisation filters through.\n\n“We haven’t seen this kind of inflation numbers in a very long time,” he said, calling India’s inflation softening a result of “bountiful supply”, not weak demand. He added that Q3 and Q4 nominal GDP growth “should be higher”.\n\nNageswaran said the stronger-than-expected first half has lifted confidence in the full-year outlook. “We are now talking about a growth rate which is either 7% or higher, that is a good situation to be in which is reflected in the GDP revisions by private sector agencies and this anchored in financial macro economic and fiscal prudence and that’s y this yr happens to be the one in which we got 3 credit ratings upgrades,” he added.\n\nHe flagged two risks: euphoric global equity markets — “something to watch out for” — and persistent geopolitical uncertainties that may shadow capital inflows.\n\nSBI’s latest Ecowrap, released after the GDP numbers, said that with 8% real GDP growth in H1 FY26, full-year growth is now expected to be around 7.6%, assuming 7.5%–7.7% growth in Q3 and 7% in Q4.\n\nThe report noted that FY26 nominal GDP could touch $4.1 trillion, reiterating that the growth momentum is “largely domestic driven.” It added that MSME credit growth in FY26 is likely to cross ₹6 lakh crore, which would be around 5.5 times higher than the cumulative 16-year average.\n\nHousehold and corporate balance sheets strengthen\n\nHousehold savings flows in FY25 saw “a very big increase”, with household balance sheets showing a two-fold rise in equity and mutual fund allocations versus FY23. The CEA said the right balance between workers and employers created by the new labour codes should support formal hiring.\n\nOutlook improves further\n\nThe government’s outlook slide highlighted:\n\nFirmer growth momentum led by manufacturing, services, festive demand and GST-led gains.\n\nStable core inflation and strong Rabi sowing supporting food supply.\n\nGST collections up 9% Apr–Oct, indicating resilient revenue.\n\nHealthier corporate balance sheets, enabling stronger private capex in H2 FY26.\n\nA confluence of stable inflation, public capex and reforms positioning India for sustained growth.\n\nNews\n\nLive TV\n\nMarket\n\nPopular Categories\n\nCalculators\n\nTrending Now\n\nLet's Connect with CNBCTV 18\n\nNetwork 18 Group :\n\n©TV18 Broadcast Limited.

On Monday morning, the Central Pollution Control Board recorded Mumbai's AQI at 9:00 a.m. as 111. However, on Sunday, Mumbai's overall AQI was 103. With the air quality continuing to fall under the 'poor' category, the civic authorities have been working on a war footing to curb the worsening pollution levels in the Maximum City. The authorities have widened the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan-4 (GRAP-4) in the worst-affected pockets of Mumbai. Mumbai GRAP 4 intensifies: What are the do's and don'ts? Mumbai's civic body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, has enforced restrictions under GRAP 4 in several areas that crossed the 'very poor' and 'severe' thresholds, including Mazgaon, Deonar, Malad, Borivali East, Chakala-Andheri East, Navy Nagar, Powai, and Mulund. Here's what are the dos and don'ts:\n\nMeanwhile, the BMC earlier reviewed the AQI spike and discussed the need for immediate measures. Dr Bhushan Gagrani, Municipal Commissioner, warned that GRAP 4 curbs would be enforced if the AQI remains above 200 for three consecutive days, aiming to reduce pollution and protect residents' health.",

The probe agency conducted searches across Jammu and Kashmir in connection with a \"white-collar\" terror module that was behind a car blast near Delhi's Red Fort. NIA conducts massive terror crackdown in Kashmir, UP The residence of Moulvi Irfan Ahmad Wagay, the mastermind of the radicalisation and recruitment of the 'white-collar' terror module, in Shopian was also searched. The agency searched the residence of Dr Adeel Ahmad Rather, who was arrested from Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur in the first week of November. Officials also carried out raids at Koil, Chandgam, Malangpora and Samboora areas of Pulwama district, alleging that these locations were linked to people associated with the Delhi car blast case. Officials said searches are underway at locations linked to suspects in Jammu and Kashmir, various districts, and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh since early Monday.\n\nThe move comes days after the agency arrested the seventh accused, Soyab of Dhauj, Faridabad, in connection with the November 10 Delhi car blast that claimed 15 lives and left several injured. Soyab allegedly sheltered the bomber, Umar Un Nabi, shortly before the terror act. He told the NIA during his interrogation that he \"not only harboured Umar but also extended logistical support to facilitate the terrorist's movements ahead of the attack.\"On November 20, the agency arrested Shaheen Saeed along with Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai of Pulwama (Jammu and Kashmir), Dr Adeel Ahmed Rather of Anantnag (Jammu and Kashmir), and Mufti Irfan Ahmad Wagay of Shopian (Jammu and Kashmir). They were taken into custody by the NIA in Srinagar on production orders issued by the district sessions judge at Patiala House court. Delhi Red Fort blast: What we know so far\n\nEarlier, the NIA arrested two other accused-- Amir Rashid Ali, in whose name the car used in the blast was registered, and Jasir Bilal Wani alias Danish, who had provided technical aid to the terrorist involved in the deadly attack. Shaheen was recently taken to Faridabad to recreate the plot of the terror plan as a massive cache of explosives (nearly 2,900 kg) was seized in Faridabad shortly before the blast, and the Hyundai i20 car used in the explosion was traced to a local dealer in the same area. The NIA said the inputs yet received have strengthened the agency's understanding of the operational network behind the bombing. The NIA is continuing to track multiple leads and conduct searches across multiple states, in collaboration with local police forces, to identify additional suspects connected to the conspiracy. Officials said efforts remain underway to fully expose and dismantle the network involved in planning and executing the deadly attack. The agency has so far confronted all seven arrested accused.\n\nThe anti-terror agency, which was handed over the investigation by the Union Home Ministry soon after the attack, is working closely with various state police forces to track and arrest every member of the terrorist module involved in the carnage. The NIA launched massive searches the next day it took over the case from the Delhi Police. (With inputs from ANI)",

Cyclone Ditwah weakens into deep depression\n\nCyclone Ditwah continued to move northwards with a speed of 10 kmph after it weakened into a deep depression over the southwest Bay of Bengal. “The Deep Depression (Remnant of Cyclonic Storm Ditwah) over southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Tamil Nadu-Puducherry coasts moved northwards with the speed of 10 kmph during past 6 hours and lay centered at 1800 UTC of the 30th November 2025 over the same region, near latitude 12.3°N and longitude 80.6°E, about 90 km south-southeast of Chennai (42379), 90 km eastsoutheast of Puducherry (43331), 110 km east-northeast of Cuddalore (43329), 180 km northnortheast of Karaikal (43346),” the IMD said. As the cyclonic storm triggered intense rainfall and severe waterlogging, the Tamil Nadu government has declared a holiday for all educational institutions in a preemptive move to ensure public safety. All schools and all educational institutions in Chennai, as well as other districts in Tamil Nadu, including Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur, will remain closed today, December 1. Even Puducherry Education Minister A Namassivayam also announced that schools, both government and private, in the four regions of the union territory will remain closed on Monday.\n\nA warning has also been issued for fishermen in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts and the Comorin area, and in its weather bulletin. “Squally wind speed reaching 55-65 gusting to 75 kmph is prevailing, and it is likely to decrease gradually, becoming 45-55 gusting to 65 kmph by 1st December morning,\" IMD said. Cyclone Ditwah: Calamities and damages Earlier, Tamil Nadu Revenue and Disaster Management Minister KKSSR Ramachandran confirmed that two victims were killed in separate wall-collapse incidents in Tuticorin and Thanjavur, while a 20-year-old youth died of electrocution in Mayiladuthurai. The cyclone has also caused the loss of 149 cattle and the submergence of 57,000 hectares of farmland across the delta region, including 24,000 hectares in Nagapattinam, 15,000 in Thiruvarur and 8,000 in Mayiladuthurai.

In the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will introduce the bill, aptly named the Health Security to National Security Cess Bill, 2025.\n\nThe plan is far more than just a standard tax measure. In contrast to the practice of taxing completed goods based on output, it aims to impose a specific cess on the machinery and industrial processes used to manufacture gutkha, pan masala, and other tobacco-based products. The production capability of a factory's machinery will be used to determine the cess rather than the factory's output. Even handcrafted goods, which frequently operate in an uncontrolled grey area, are subject to a set monthly cess that is required for every unit.\n\nThe government seeks to raise new funds for national security and health, two areas it claims are directly impacted by the extent of tobacco use and the illegal trade that goes along with it, according to officials engaged in the legislation's preparation.\n\nRegardless of changes in their output, manufacturers will be required to deposit the cess each month under the new structure. Only if a machine or process is shut down for more than 15 days may relief be provided; this clause is anticipated to cause intense discussion among industry participants.\n\nAll manufacturers, regardless of size, will also need to register with the government, submit monthly returns, and allow authorised officials to inspect, investigate, and audit their operations. The Finance Ministry thinks that these inspections will help control a sector that has long been criticised for its opaque operations and pervasive tax fraud.\n\nThe Bill suggests severe penalties for infractions, including up to five years in prison. However, businesses will still be able to contest orders from appellate authorities all the way up to the Supreme Court, guaranteeing a legal route for disagreements.\n\nImportantly, the government will retain the authority to double the cess if necessary, providing the Center significant control over the economics of the sector.\n\nIf approved, the bill will represent one of the most extensive regulatory changes in the history of the tobacco-related products sector in India.",

Read here to know more about this project\n\nApurwa Amit\n\nUpdated : Dec 01, 2025, 07:00 AM IST\n\nThe people of Uttar Pradesh are in for a treat as the state government is planning to expand its metro rail network to smaller cities, providing citizens with easier access to this convenient mode of transportation. The Uttar Pradesh government is working on a plan to ensure that metro rail facilities are available in both small and big cities, allowing residents to enjoy the benefits of metro travel, just like those in Delhi and Noida.\n\nThe Metro Rail Corporation has revealed its ambitious plans to increase the metro rail network in Uttar Pradesh, with a focus on smaller cities. According to Sushil Kumar, Managing Director of the Metro Rail Corporation, the plan is to operate 225 kilometers of metro rail in Lucknow and 200 kilometers in Kanpur by 2047. The corporation is also planning to develop 150-kilometer metro corridors in Noida, Greater Noida, Varanasi, and Prayagraj.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh govt is looking to expand its services to smaller cities, including Gorakhpur, Bareilly, Moradabad, Meerut, Jhansi, Ayodhya, Mathura-Vrindavan, Aligarh, and Saharanpur, with plans to operate 50 kilometers of metro rail in each of these cities. The corporation is exploring possibilities of metro rail services in other cities as well. The plan is to complete approximately 790 kilometers of the total 1575-kilometer network by 2035, with an estimated annual investment of around 1527 crore rupees.\n\nThe Metro Rail Corporation's efforts aim to improve connectivity and efficiency in the state's transportation system. With the introduction of metro rail services in smaller cities, residents will have access to a convenient and efficient mode of transportation, reducing dependence on other modes of transport. The corporation's existing metro systems are already operating efficiently, with maximum revenue per kilometer and minimum expenses, setting a national standard for operational efficiency in Tier-2 cities.\n\nThe Metro Rail Corporation is working to ensure a seamless travel experience for passengers. In Kanpur, for instance, passengers will not have to change metro trains at Motijheel to reach the Central station. The corporation is planning to start a trial run of the metro from IIT Kanpur to Naubasta from January 26, and with the completion of five crossovers, passengers will be able to travel from IIT to Central without changing trains at Motijheel.",

The city's air quality remains in the 'Poor' category, with an AQI of 297 at 6 am, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The city had recorded an AQI of 279 at 4 pm on November 30. The city's air quality remained in the 'poor' category despite slight fluctuations. Delhi-NCR AQI on December 1, 2025\n\nMany areas across the city recorded a 'very poor' AQI, with Anand Vihar recording an AQI of 323, Ashok Nagar recording an AQI of 304, and Bawana reporting 337. Other prominent areas, including Jahangirpuri (319), Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (311), and Burari Crossing (304), also fell under the 'very poor' category. The air quality in the national capital region also remained in the 'poor category' with Gurugram reporting an AQI of 218, Faridabad at 228, Ghaziabad at 269, Greater Noida at 257, and Noida at 316, according to CPCB. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) NCR and Adjoining Areas on Saturday has revised the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for the entire NCR, directing the measures for 'Severe' AQI category under GRAP Stage IV to be taken under GRAP Stage III, a press release said. According to a press release by CAQM, as measures under GRAP IV are now under GRAP III, the NCR State Governments/GNCTD will decide whether public, municipal, and private offices can operate at 50 per cent strength, with the rest working from home. The Central Government may decide to permit work from home for employees in central government offices. Delhi air quality in Jan-Nov 2025\n\nMeanwhile, the air quality scenario in Delhi-NCR has shown a consistent improvement this year, with the region recording its lowest average AQI for the January-November period in the last eight years, excluding 2020 -- the COVID-19 lockdown year, according to data shared on Sunday. As per official figures, Delhi's average AQI between January and November 2025 stood at 187, an improvement over 201 in 2024, 190 in 2023, 199 in 2022, 197 in 2021, 203 in 2019, and 213 in 2018. The period also saw a significant reduction in the number of days with \"Severe\" air quality. Only three days recorded a daily average AQI above 400 this year, compared with 11 in 2024, 12 in 2023, and 17 in 2021. Notably, no day in 2025 so far has recorded AQI levels above 450 ('Severe+'), unlike previous years. (With inputs from ANI)\n\n",

The Winter Session of Parliament is set to start from Monday, December 1.\n\nANI\n\nUpdated : Dec 01, 2025, 12:49 AM IST\n\nAn all-party meeting was held at the Parliament House Complex on Sunday to discuss preparations for the Winter Session of Parliament. Chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the meeting saw the participation of 50 leaders from 36 political parties, including several Union Ministers, with the aim of ensuring a constructive and productive session. The winter session of Parliament is set to take place on Monday, December 1 and will continue till December 19, as announced by Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju.\n\nThe opposition MPs have decided to raise many issues involving discussions related to the ongoing SIR, equality, income, delhi blast, pollution and foreign policy. RJD leader MP Manoj Kumar told ANI, \"Most of the political discussions are fictional, even during the elections, while the basic issues of the public are being ignored. The mainstream media is largely responsible for this. I hope the government thinks beyond elections. Aren't income and equality the issues to discuss? If we talk about India's GDP growth story and see that it's not reflected in daily life, shouldn't we discuss it?\" \"If we talk about the concerns people have regarding the SIR, then see if we had not appealed to the Supreme Court, the relief the public received in terms of documents would not have been possible as well. These need to be discussed in detail; otherwise, Parliament will remain a museum-like structure,\" he said.\n\nCongress MP Pramod Tiwari said, \"The SIR was conducted across the entire state in a very short span of time, which is impossible. Blasts have occurred in the capital. Prime Minister Modi's foreign policies are completely lost. In addition, air pollution in Delhi and other states must be discussed in detail. We have a strategic meeting today at 6 pm, and the Business Advisory Committee meeting is happening at 4 pm. Let us see what is on the BJP's agenda.\" Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi told ANI, \"I hope the upcoming session will be a productive one. There will be discussions on important issues of the country. I know the ruling side has an agenda, but the opposition has one as well. As you can see, during the SIR, so many BLOs are working under pressure, and so many have lost their lives...The process has become inhumane and insensitive, raising many questions. Revelations have also emerged regarding Aaditya Thackeray's alleged vote theft in the Mumbai constituency, made during a press conference. Rahul Gandhi has also raised several issues, citing Karantaka and Haryana. The misuse of our agencies is also an issue. These are all the issues. Whether it's the issue of pollution or adulterated food, which are the opposition's issues, and I hope we will get a chance to discuss them too. These issues will be raised at the All-Party Meeting. With the hope that the Central government keeps the Parliament functioning smoothly, we will function accordingly,\" she said.\n\nCPI MP P Sandosh Kumar told ANI, \"Tomorrow the session begins. Today, we will have a formal discussion and express our views, but the ruling party will accept nothing. They must have prepared a list of bills, and they will also come up with new agendas. Last time, the list included some suggested bills, but on the penultimate day, they introduced a new constitutional amendment. I have little faith in this meeting, but we will all attend and register our views. As far as my party, CPI, is concerned, we will demand a discussion on the Election Commission's functioning.\" He said, \"The Election Commission is a constitutional authority, but the parliament also has every right to discuss its functioning. Why is it required? The Election Commission is not accepting proposals from political parties. Registered political parties are an integral part of the system. So, the Election Commission should understand their views and take them into account. But the Election Commission deliberately holds ritualistic meetings and rejects any suggestions, especially those from opposition parties. So why is it so? Suppose, on electoral reforms, why can't they take the views of opposition parties? We come prepared with our notes, give suggestions, and express our views, but they stick to their own decision. The SIR, vote-chori, many issues are related to the Election Commission's functioning. We will demand a discussion on the functioning of the Election Commission in the Parliament.\"\n\nCongress leader and MP Tanuj Punia told ANI, \"All our issues are for the benefit of the public. Our efforts are always to put the public's issues forward. Our respected leader, Rahul Gandhi, is always upfront about public issues. Our biggest concern right now is the way fake voters are being added during the SIR while genuine voters are being removed. We will raise the questions being raised about the entire SIR process. Thus, SIR will be the main issue.\" Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that the government is fully prepared to address the opposition's concerns, even as some leaders warned of creating a ruckus in Parliament over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls during the winter session.\n\nSpeaking to reporters following an all-party meeting today, Rijiju said that the government is prepared to address the issue, emphasising that Parliament \"belongs to everyone\" and urging all parties to uphold the sanctity of parliamentary debate. \"No one said that Parliament will not function or will not let it function. Some leaders said they can create a ruckus in the House over SIR. I am saying this in a positive manner that we are ready to listen to the opposition... Parliament belongs to everyone; it belongs to the country. There is a method to discuss every issue in Parliament. There are rules, there are conventions,\" the Union Minister said. On the all-party meeting, Rijiju described the meeting, attended by 50 leaders from 36 political parties, as \"very good and very productive\" and assured that all suggestions would be placed before the Business Advisory Committees of both Houses.\n\nHe further appealed for cooperation during discussions in both houses, noting that the differences in democracies are natural but must not translate into disruptions. \"The meeting was very good and very productive. I thank the floor leaders of all political parties. Everyone participated and presented their party's views. We will consider all suggestions received today from the floor leaders of political parties and present them to the Business Advisory Committee. 36 political parties and 50 leaders attended this meeting. On behalf of the government, I assure you that we will continue to engage with the opposition in this manner to ensure the smooth functioning of the Winter Session of Parliament,\" Rijiju said. \"I also request opposition party leaders to cooperate in ensuring the smooth functioning of Parliament. In democracies, especially parliamentary democracies, deadlocks occur. There are differences among political parties. Everyone has to work with their own ideologies and agendas, so there will be differences. Despite these differences, if we all decide not to disturb the House, whatever opposition we want to raise, we should do so by speaking in the House. We should not disrupt the House in any way. House proceedings should continue,\" he added.\n\nToday, the Lok Sabha's Business Advisory Committee (BAC) has allocated time for several key bills and discussions for the Winter Session. The government has listed 13 Bills for the session, many of which have not been examined by a Standing Committee. The BAC has recommended a time for several key legislative items and debates. According to the BAC schedule, the Manipur Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill and the Central Excise Bills will each be discussed for three hours. Similarly, the Supplementary Demand for Grants has been allotted three hours of debate. The Health Cess Bill, which is scheduled for introduction this week, has been allocated six hours for discussion. The government has also proposed a 10-hour debate on the 'Vande Mataram' issue, though the Speaker will take the final decision on this.\n\nThe House Business Advisory Committee (BAC) recommends the time to be allocated for business in the House. This Committee has Members from the ruling and opposition parties. The Session is scheduled to take up several important bills and financial matters. Some of the key legislative business includes: Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025; Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Manipur Goods and Services Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 2025; Repealing and Amending Bill, 2025; National Highways (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Atomic Energy Bill, 2025; Corporate laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Securities Markets Code Bill (SMC), 2025; Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Higher Education Commission of India Bill, 2025; Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and Health Security and National Security Cess Bill, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will brief accredited media representatives on the opening day of the Sixth Session of the Eighteenth Lok Sabha on December 1 (Monday) at 10:00 am. The briefing will take place at Hans Dwar, Parliament House. The INDIA bloc floor leaders have also called for a meeting at the office of Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge in Parliament on Monday. Parliament is set to have 15 sittings across 19 days. Private Members' Bills are set to be taken for consideration on December 5 and 19, and Private Members' resolutions on December 12.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from news agency ANI).",

Rohit Dhankar was attacked after he objected to indecent behaviour at a wedding programme. He succumbed to his wounds while undergoing treatment at Pandit BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak on Saturday.\n\nOn Thursday evening (November 27), 28-year-old Dhankar and his friend Jatin went to attend a wedding ceremony in Rewari Khera. At the venue, they had an argument with some of the guests after Dhankar called out their unruly conduct. As Dhankar and Jatin  were returning to Rohtak after the ceremony, their car was hit from behind and they were surrounded by a group of 15 to 20 men. The men ruthlessly assaulted Dhankar with iron rods and hockey sticks, leaving him severely injured. Jatin somehow managed to escape the attack. Dhankar was first admitted to Bhiwani General Hospital, but after his condition deteriorated, he was referred to the Rohtak hospital, where he died.\n\nPolice have registered a case and detained six people in connection to the assault. They have also seized one of the vehicles used in the attack. Dhankar was a two-time junior para national record-holder and seven-time senior para national champion. He had also represented India internationally in para powerlifting. Dhankar had been working as a gym trainer. He had also been honoured by former Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, his uncle told the media. \"There were around 30 to 35 bruise marks on his body.

At a recent event, Madani questioned the treatment of Muslims in India and said that there will be \"jihad\" whenever there is oppression. He also accused the government and the judiciary of undermining the rights of minority communities, inviting sharp retorts from leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said the Jamiat head was inciting Muslims. But, who is Mahmood Madani? Let us tell you more about him here.\n\nMaulana Mahmood Madani is the current national president of the Jamiat Ulema-E-Hind (JUH) -- one of India's oldest and largest Islamic organisations. Born in 1964, Madani hails from a prominent family of religious clerics. His grandfather, Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani, was a well-known theologian. Mahmood's father, Maulana As'ad Madani, was a member of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament) for nearly 17 years and a key leader of the JUH. Mahmood Madani studied Islamic theology at Darul Uloom Deoband, completing his studies in 1992. He has held several important positions in the Jamiat and was also a Rajya Sabha MP from 2006 to 2012. He has been part of interfaith dialogues, anti-terrorism campaigns, as well as relief work during riots and disasters.\n\nAt a Jamiat meeting in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal on Saturday, Madani said: \"One community has always been targeted. Injustice will lead to jihad. If there is oppression, then there will be jihad.\" Referring to a number of legal cases, including the Babri Masjid one, he said that courts were failing Muslims and working \"under government pressure.\" Madani has alleged discrimination against Muslims and made controversial remarks in the past as well.",

That is normal in democracy. However, it is time to move beyond campaign conflicts and personal attacks,” he said on Monday (Dec 1).\n\nDonald said this was especially important among Sabahans.\n\n“Now is the time for us to unite, strengthen our voice and demand that Sabahans’ rights be respected and fulfilled. How can we expect Sabah’s rights to be restored if we remain divided,” he said.\n\nDonald said a state government must be formed soon to pass the 2026 Budget within a month.\n\n“Without a state budget, Sabah risks an administrative standstill next year. We cannot let that happen,” he added.\n\nSimilarly, Penampang Upko Youth chief Billy Joe Dominic said backing GRS was necessary as it won 29 seats and Warisan won 25 seats.\n\n“Even if every other local party supported Warisan they still cannot reach a simple majority without parties from Peninsular Malaysia,” he said.\n\n“GRS is the rightful first choice coalition to form a government as it won the most seats,” said Billy.\n\nHe said GRS did not attack Upko during the campaign.\n\n“This made the decision much clearer for us. GRS genuinely signalled willingness to work together,” he added.\n\nBilly, who is a special officer to Upko president Datuk Ewon Benedick, said Upko and Ewon were targeted by Warisan’s campaigns.\n\n“Warisan made it clear they had no intention to work with Upko,” he said.\n\nSabah STAR, led by Datuk Seri Jeffrey Kitingan, recently pledged support to GRS.\n\nIt had left GRS days before nomination for the Sabah elections.\n\nIn the Sabah polls, GRS won 29 seats while Warisan won 25.\n\nBarisan Nasional won six seats, Upko three and Sabah STAR two.\n\nParti KDM and Pakatan won one each and five independents won seats.\n\n\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nLarvotto Resources has secured an exclusive option to acquire the Blockade mine, a successful historic copper operation strategically enclosed by the company’s existing Mt Isa tenements in northwest Queensland.\n\nThe 152.7-hectare Blockade mining lease, 41 kilometres east-northeast of Mount Isa, initially fed silica flux - running up to 70 per cent silica - to the Mt Isa Smelter from the early 1900s.\n\nLarvotto Resources has secured an exclusive option to acquire the Blockade mine, a historic copper operation, 41km east-northeast of Queensland’s Mt Isa mining centre.\n\nThe mine then transitioned to high-grade copper ore extraction from a shallow oxide pit mined by Mt Isa Mines in the 1980s, before the mining giant eventually walked away, leaving significant upside in unmined zones.\n\nThe Blockade project aligns perfectly with Larvotto’s vision for a regional hub-and-spoke development. It also benefits from close proximity to world-class infrastructure and the massively productive Mt Isa copper belt - home to Glencore’s flagship operation, which produces 300,000 tonnes per annum of copper cathode.\n\nPrivate vendor Kilo Copper completed about 4000m of reverse circulation (RC) drilling between 2010 and 2011, defining broad mineralised envelopes which enclose high-grade core lodes.\n\nKilo’s work confirmed that surface copper carbonates and oxide breccias overlie deeper sulphides dominated by copper sulphides including chalcopyrite and iron sulphide, with continuous minor native copper evident along strike and down-dip.\n\n‘The current known mineralisation is open in all directions and drilling to date has only tested to a depth of 100 metres.’\n\nMineralisation runs along a northwest-trending fault that dips steeply at about 70 degrees to the southwest. It sits within a slim band of actinolite schist, with tougher quartzite and greywacke rocks on either side. Drilling has only probed the system down to 100m depth, although it still appears to remain open in every direction.\n\nHistorical drilling analyses acquired from Kilo Copper’s drilling between July 2010 and June 2011 underscore the deposit’s quality and potential.\n\nLarvotto Resources managing director Ron Heeks said: “Acquiring the Blockade Mine that was previously mined for High Grade copper by Mount Isa Mines Ltd has been a strategic priority that we have pursued over several years to complement our Mt Isa portfolio. Blockade, which we surround, has the potential to form an integral part of a regional hub-and-spoke operation and serve as the basis of near-term copper production from the existing mine.”\n\nThe top drill hole from the program delivered a very respectable intercept of 71m assaying 1.63 per cent copper and 484 parts per million (ppm) cobalt from 29m, including 37m going 2.48 per cent copper and 604ppm cobalt from 29m.\n\nThe second best hit gave up 70m at 1.36 per cent copper and 397ppm cobalt from 72m, with an included 10m at 3.21 per cent copper and 953ppm cobalt from 73m.\n\nThe third best copper intercept of the program came from a 12m intercept going 4.31 per cent copper and 54ppm cobalt from 14m, within a broader run of 26m at 2.36 per cent copper and 89ppm cobalt from 5m depth.\n\nThree top cobalt assays from two separate holes included 7m at 1075ppm, which included 3m grading 1119ppm in one hole, while a second hole delivered 2m going at 1081ppm cobalt.\n\nLarvotto plans to immediately kick off diligence drilling, with a targeted six-hole program of about 1500m of RC drilling to validate Kilo’s hits, extend mineralisation northwest along strike, scout parallel faults and chase deeper sulphide copper mineralisation below 100m vertical depth.\n\nResults, which are expected to be delivered early in the first quarter of next, will feed preliminary resource modelling to firm up the $1 million acquisition cost to be funded by cash and/or shares - at Larvotto’s choice - following a $400,000 exploration commitment. The initial acquisition cost will be topped up with further production- based payments, capped at $10M.\n\nIf validated, Blockade could fast-track Larvotto’s Mt Isa presence from green-fields to a near-term producer, complementing its flagship Hillgrove antimony-gold project in New South Wales.\n\nThe company recently found itself in headlines after rejecting a US$723M (A$1.1 billion) takeover bid from US antimony processor, United States Antimony Corporation.\n\nLarvotto believed the offer vastly undervalued its NSW Hillgrove gold-antimony project with 1.7 million ounce gold equivalent resource and a feasibility economics study, which, from its mid-case pricing scenario, delivers an average annual EBITDA of $250M over an 8.2-year mine life.\n\nWith copper prices holding strong amid global supply strains and Blockade sitting in the heart of Australia’s premier copper province, Larvotto’s low-capex entry looks ready to position the company for scalable growth in a Tier-1 district.\n\nThe company’s fast-tracked validation drilling could rapidly convert the historical high-grade drill hits into a modern resource to deliver another potential spoke in the company’s emerging Mt Isa hub-and-spoke production strategy and shine a new spotlight onto Mt Isa’s next copper chapter.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

    "content": "We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nThe hunt for a Brisbane Lions’ dynasty to rival that of the early 2000s will begin without three of their premiership heroes, but champion defender Harris Andrews insists a new dawn beckons.\n\nAs the senior members of the two-time defending premiers returned to Brighton Homes Arena to launch their preseason, the next generation of stars to don the maroon, blue and yellow were setting about forging their own destinies.\n\nEven Australian sprint sensation Gout Gout was in attendance, completing a training session at the club’s indoor facility as he fixes his gaze on conquering the world ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nJaspa Fletcher, Oscar Allen and Daniel Annable will all lace up for the Lions in 2026. Credit: Getty\n\n“I could not be further away from moving like Gout Gout,” Andrews laughed.\n\n“He does a bit of stuff in the kick room and that sort of thing, it’s very impressive to see how explosive he is. I don’t think I’ll try jumping in on any training like that, I have a shocking running style, but it’s very impressive, and he’s a pretty unbelievable athlete.”\n\nFor a squad now deprived of Brandon Starcevich (West Coast), Callum Ah Chee (Adelaide) and Oscar McInerney (retirement) from the men who lifted the 2025 AFL trophy, there are holes suddenly to fill.\n\nBut Andrews was confident the baton would be passed to a gaggle of contenders who would not deter the Lions’ quest for a ‘three-peat’, one that would put them in the same company of the famed 2001-03 sides under the tutelage of legendary Leigh Matthews.\n\nThe fact Brisbane snared former Eagles captain Oscar Allen to replace Ah Chee in the forward line is a massive indicator of how coach Chris Fagan’s outfit have become one of the destination clubs of the competition.\n\nEssendon big man Sam Draper has also joined the fold, with the 2017 No.1 draftee pick looming as the ruck replacement for McInerney. The recruited pair arrived last week and had gruelling fitness sessions under the Queensland sun.\n\nAlready the 26-year-old Allen, who missed most of the 2025 season after undergoing knee surgery while still recovering from calf and Achilles issues, has made an impression on Andrews and the role he could play in nurturing rising young forwards Logan Morris, Kai Lohmann and Ty Gallop.\n\nThe Eagles’ Oscar Allen will join the Lions next season. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images\n\n“It’s obviously disappointing to lose Cal, but he’s got to look after his family at the same time, and he’s a little bit closer to home [in Western Australia] which is important,” Andrews said.\n\n“I wouldn’t go as far as to say we’re the destination club of the AFL, but we’ve definitely been able to do a good job over the last five years of getting some really high-quality recruits. Oscar was the captain of West Coast, so I’ll certainly be picking his brain a little bit about leadership, and he’ll offer a lot in that space to us.”\n\nOther additions to the Den have included highly touted draftee Daniel Annable, with the No.6 pick seeking to force his way into a midfield boasting Lachie Neale, Hugh McCluggage, Josh Dunkley and Ashcroft brothers Will and Levi.\n\nAlready he has caught Andrews’ eye, who lauded the teenager as “super fit, very skillful and a really great football brain”, who would thrive with the motivation of “trying to knock some of the older guys off their perch”.\n\nAs for replacing Starcevich, who missed large chunks of 2025 with concussion, rising star Jaspa Fletcher will take on a more senior role once he heals from shoulder surgery – a task he was embracing alongside wounded teammate Jarrod Berry (shoulder).\n\nFinishing with a career-best campaign for disposals (575 at 21.3 a game), inside 50s (68 at 2.52) and rebound 50s (91 at 3.37) after finding a home in the backline, Fletcher was adamant he had other gears to reach.\n\n“It’s a different challenge for me and something I haven’t quite experienced coming back from an operation. [But] I’m looking forward to it, and I’ve got a great mate in Bez beside me to get me through,” Fletcher said.\n\n“I was pretty proud of my year, but I know I can get better. Post my operation I was looking to 2026, I’ll be trying to attack my rehab as best I can and get my body ready to go – I’m able to run now which is nice.”\n\nAndrews said Starcevich would be a hard man to replace.\n\n“He’s one of the all-time great teammates to play with – so tough and resilient down there – and we’ll obviously miss his ability to lock down on really dangerous small forwards,” he said.\n\n“But at the same time, I think he missed maybe 13 or 14 games last year and ... we were able to work our way through that. When guys unfortunately leave, other guys step up.”\n\nCopyright © 2025",

Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nQueensland GPs can now diagnose and prescribe medication for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, saving patients hundreds of dollars, in a move described as life changing for people living with the condition.\n\nQueensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls announced last month that GPs would be able to diagnose and manage the treatment of adults with ADHD – a condition marked by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity – with the changes to come into effect from December 1.\n\nNicholls said almost 1000 GPs had enrolled for additional training to deliver ADHD care, from a cohort of 9000, since the announcement was made.\n\nQueensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls announced the changes to ADHD care for adults at the RACGP conference in Brisbane last month. Credit: RACGP\n\n“That’s a phenomenal result and shows just how much this service is both needed and how seriously GPs take the delivery of these services,” Nicholls said.\n\nADHD affects an estimated 1 million Australians, including more than 530,000 adults.\n\nQueensland GPs have been able to diagnose and treat children aged between four and 17 with ADHD since 2017.\n\nUntil now, adults seeking diagnosis have had to visit a specialist, usually a psychiatrist, with a referral from a GP.\n\nSuch specialist appointments can cost upwards of $1000 and incur waiting periods of up to a year, making care inaccessible for many people.\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) estimates the new reform will save patients between $500 and $1400 a year in out-of-pocket expenses and expedite diagnoses.\n\nThe move has not been without criticism. A Brisbane-based GP who spoke to this masthead on the condition of anonymity said the process to identify ADHD was based on “vague inclusion criteria”, which could lead to a surge in false diagnoses.\n\nThey also expressed fears the change could trigger a potentially unethical rise in health experts providing diagnosis – and access to drugs – for payment.\n\n“It’s being sold as a cheaper option to come and see a GP, but the market will absolutely adapt, so the GPs will then charge more because it’s a sought-after service,” they said.\n\nBeyondGP director Dr Carmel Toole said that GPs were trained to recognise ADHD and often had more in-depth relationships with their patients than psychiatrists did. But she said the success of the scheme was dependent on access to training.\n\n“It’s complex for all parties concerned and training is vital,” Toole told 4BC Mornings.\n\n“I think GPs and psychiatrists alike, while welcoming the ease of access for patients, are concerned about quality care in the absence of training.\n\n“I’d like the general public to take a bit of a deep breath and allow their GPs time to find their feet with this and to access training.”\n\nNicholls said the scheme would be monitored in line with other states introducing similar changes.\n\n“This hasn’t been done overnight. This has been done through collaboration over a lengthy period of time,” he said.\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Although the structures are separated by a large quartz diorite intrusion, both appear to share the same skarn mineralisation.\n\nKotlovi was first discovered 12 months ago after Strickland tested a coincident multi-element soil anomaly and an induced polarisation anomaly. The drill bit went on to jag a whopping 40.3m intersection grading 2.6g/t gold, including 12m at 5.7g/t gold from regional exploration scout drilling.\n\nThe company then backed up that discovery hole with a diamond drilling program in August, which returned exceptional gold hits of 277.3m grading 1.3g/t gold equivalent, including multiple higher-grade zones of 33.5m grading 2.9g/t gold and 8.8m at 4.7g/t gold.\n\nStrickland Metals managing director Paul L’Herpiniere said: “Kotlovi is continuing to shape up as an important new discovery at Rogozna, with the potential to make a significant contribution to the project’s overall growth trajectory. These latest drill results have further expanded the known mineralisation, which now extends over a 300m strike length.”\n\nKotlovi makes up just one cog in the wheel of the company’s huge Rogozna gold and base metal project. Seven rigs are currently humming away across the wider project area as part of a 50,000-metre budgeted programme of diamond drilling for 2025. Assay results for the recently completed holes are expected to be released in coming weeks.\n\nThe Rogozna project lies in the heart of Serbia’s Trepca mineral district, one of Europe’s largest base metal mining centres. Access to the project area, which lies 400 kilometres south of Belgrade, is made easier by the many highways and well-maintained roads in the region.\n\nSerbia is Europe’s second largest copper producer and is a well-regulated, established mining jurisdiction with a modern mining code. Last year, the country signed a deal with the European Union to create a strategic partnership for the supply of critical minerals used in batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nSeveral other major global mining companies also have significant gold and base metal projects in country, including BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale, Zijin Mining, Kinross Gold and Dundee Precious Metals. Serbia has a highly skilled workforce and excellent infrastructure, as well as a highly favourable fiscal regime.\n\nAcquired for $37 million in 2024, Rogozna benefits from Serbia’s 15 per cent tax rate and mining-friendly policies.\n\nStrickland’s Rogozna project has the potential to become one of the largest undeveloped gold and base metal deposits in the world. No doubt multiple discovery opportunities and resource upgrades from its Shanac and Gradina prospects will likely keep the company extremely busy. However, the exciting possibility of merging Medenovac with Kotlovi as one large deposit is now likely to become a key focus in its resource development plans for 2026.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Credit: TGA\n\nThe TGA’s search of its Database of Adverse Event Notifications for GLP-1 RA medicines on September 23 retrieved 85 reports, including 72 for suicidal ideation, six for depressional suicide, four for suicide attempt, two for suicide and one of self-injurious ideation.\n\nIts investigation included seeking advice from an independent expert group, the Advisory Committee on Medicines, which in June reported that there was insufficient evidence of a causal link between the medicines and suicidal ideation or behaviours.\n\nBut the advisory committee found there was a “complex interplay between mental illness and chronic endocrine disorders” (which GLP-1 RAs may be used to treat) and “the potential relationship between weight loss and suicidal or self-harm ideation”.\n\nIt noted that the product information across this class of medicines was inconsistent and should be “harmonised”. It recommended updating the safety advice after taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of doing so, including validating community concerns and the potential risks of causing undue alarm where evidence is lacking.\n\nMounjaro’s product warning will also be updated after the TGA’s investigation found the drug’s potential to render oral contraception less effective “could not be ruled out”.\n\nA 2024 review included one study that found tirzepatide reduced the amount of ethinylestradiol (synthetic oestrogen in the combined oral contraceptive pill) in the bloodstream by 20 per cent. Five other studies did not show a statistically or clinically significant difference.\n\nAnother study found that tirzepatide increased the time it took the ethinylestradiol to be fully absorbed into the bloodstream from two to four hours, which could be due to the drug’s effect of slowing stomach emptying because ethinylestradiol is mostly absorbed in the small intestine .\n\nPatients will now be advised to switch to non-oral contraception or use a barrier method (such as condoms) for contraception for four weeks after first taking the medication and for four weeks after increasing the dose.\n\n“None of the GLP-1 RAs should be used during pregnancy, and individuals of childbearing potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with a GLP-1 RA,” the alert reads.\n\nThe British medicines regulator issued advice in August to all individuals of child-bearing age to ensure they do not become pregnant while taking GLP-1 RAs because there is not enough safety data to know whether they can cause harm to fetuses. The regulator received more than 40 reports of unintended pregnancies by women using the drugs.\n\nOzempic owner Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro, have been contacted for comment.\n\nIf you or anyone you know needs support, call Lifeline 131 114, Beyond Blue 1300 224 636, or PANDA between 9am and 7.30pm on 1300 726 306.\n\nMake the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our Live Well newsletter .

    "content": "We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nThe life of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant could be extended for a second time as NSW Premier Chris Minns flagged he was open to a deal to avoid blackouts if the plant shuttered before the grid could cope.\n\nEnergy experts declared on Monday the electricity grid would not be ready for Eraring, the nation’s largest coal-fired power station, to shut down by its scheduled end date in mid-2027. The warnings came after the Australian Energy Market Operator said there would be a heightened risk of blackouts from the time when Eraring is set to close.\n\nA generation unit at Origin Energy’s Eraring coal plant, during scheduled maintenance work.\n\nOfficials are increasingly worried that, while there are enough renewables and power lines under construction to replace coal plants, there will not be enough infrastructure to prevent sudden blackouts by maintaining a safe and stable electricity flow.\n\nMinns on Monday gave his strongest indication that his government was willing to work with Origin Energy, which owns Eraring, on a deal to delay its planned closure date.\n\n“We are not necessarily opposed to a conversation with them about it,” Minns said.\n\nSuch a deal is expected to require taxpayers to provide a guarantee worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year if the Eraring plant is required to keep running at a loss.\n\nThe state government offered in 2024 to cover potential losses of Eraring, valued at up to $225 million a year, in a deal to ensure Origin ran the plant past its former 2025 closure deadline. Origin agreed to the deal but did not activate it as it made money in a favourable energy market.\n\nWhile Origin has not activated that deal, there is an option for it to kick in from 2027 until 2029, but the terms have not been written.\n\nEnergy expert Matt Rennie, at Rennie Advisory, said the grid would not be able to cope in the short term without Eraring.\n\n“We need to pay proper regard to the reality that coal will come out of the system at some point, and therefore the preparation for the new energy system is absolutely critical,” Rennie said.\n\nMacquarie Equities infrastructure analyst Ian Myles said market watchers are already factoring in Eraring’s closure being deferred under another agreement with the NSW government.\n\n“My expectation is, and we’ve modelled this, that Eraring will be operational until 2029. That is probably a common expectation [across markets],” he said.\n\nGrattan Institute senior fellow Tony Wood said it was likely Eraring would need to stay open beyond 2027, but bill payers would bear a cost even if AEMO advised there was an option to function without the plant.\n\n“Even if the grid limps along without Eraring, there’ll be costs, and what would annoy me if I lived in NSW is the question: who’s going to pay for all this?”\n\nAEMO said on Monday that NSW grid owner Transgrid is racing to install new equipment to keep the grid stable, but that equipment is unlikely to be delivered until “at least 2028”.\n\nTo run smoothly, power grids must not only match supply and demand, but also maintain “system security”, including inertia, which comes from the steady frequency traditionally provided by the spinning turbines of gas, coal and pumped hydro plants.\n\nGood system security enables the grid to ride through sudden spikes or lulls in demand, power line faults or power plant breakdowns.\n\nMost of Australia’s coal plants are scheduled to retire by 2035, while soaring maintenance costs and competition from renewables are driving owners to speed plans for closures.\n\nAEMO has warned that the loss of inertia and system strength from the scheduled closure of Origin’s Eraring coal plant in 2027 would create a heightened blackout risk in NSW.\n\nIf Eraring does close in 2027, another option to keep the grid stable would be to secure extra supply from gas or hydropower to meet minimum system strength requirements, the cost of which would be ultimately borne by bill payers.\n\nNSW government was aiming to speed up Transgrid’s installation of synchronous condensers – grid-connected machines that don’t burn fuel but deliver the same stabilising effects as the spinning turbines of coal and gas plants.\n\nMinns said his government this year passed new laws to fast-track synchronous condensers, “a crucial piece of infrastructure”.\n\nHe also said despite warnings that the extension would slow down the rollout of renewable energy, NSW was number one in the country for renewable energy investment.\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the federal government was getting on with building the renewables grid as Opposition Leader Sussan Ley warned that “this government’s energy policy has not recognised that you need baseload generation in the system for as long as it takes to transition to affordable renewable alternatives”.\n\nOrigin has said it would not close Eraring if there was a need to keep it running.\n\n“Origin has always acted responsibly in this regard, and the community should have confidence we will continue to do so,” a spokesperson said.\n\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

    "content": "Three years on from the firebombing of the home of Jordan Shanks, AKA friendlyjordies, an ABC Four Corners reporter has allegedly made death threats against the YouTuber.\n\nThe ABC journalist and former bikie gang member, Mahmood Fazal , allegedly sent the following text to his podcast co-host and former gang associate, Ryan Naumenko :\n\n“Fuckin’ Jordies and his people they’re dogs I wanna kill him so bad.”\n\nThat was on 2 October. However, not only has the ABC journalist not been investigated by his employer over the alleged threat, Fazal is still employed by the national broadcaster.\n\nSMH ’s Kate McClymont reported Naumenko stated on YouTube:\n\n‘…that Fazal demanded payment in cash and that he had not told his employer, the ABC, that he was being paid. Naumenko later identified that the money funding the podcast was coming from online gambling firm Vegastars.\n\n…However, Naumenko said he would not be co-operating with the ABC’s investigation into what he described as Fazal’s “side-hustle”.’\n\nABC management says it is investigating allegations that Fazal received payment for a podcast he presented with Naumenko.\n\nIn a statement provided to Media Watch , an ABC spokesperson deals with the unauthorised remuneration Fazal may or may not have received for the podcast:\n\n‘Mahmood’s immediate manager endorsed him taking part in a podcast interview, based on the information provided to him. The interview did not receive final approval by the ABC as part of the external work guidelines. After the interview aired, which included gambling ads, his manager withdrew endorsement of the work. ABC management is thoroughly investigating this matter.’\n\nInterestingly, there is no mention of alleged death threats or crime connections.\n\nFazal has since accused podcast co-host Naumenko of faking the text messages containing death threats.\n\nBack in 2022, Shanks’ home was deliberately firebombed following a friendlyjordies video, in which he discussed the Alameddine crime network.\n\nIt was the second arson attempt intended for Shanks, with an earlier attack wrongly targeting his next-door neighbour. NSW Police investigated both firebombings.\n\nOnly one of the men behind the November 2022 deliberate firebombing of Shanks’ home has since been gaoled over the arson attack. Police alleged Tauese-Auelua was an associate of the Alameddine crime family and scouted out the home before setting it ablaze.\n\nTufi Junior Tauese-Auelua, expressed remorse during his sentencing, yet no further details have come to light about the other people involved, who ordered the arson attack or why. No motive or any further information on the circumstances behind Tauese-Auelua’s involvement were detailed in court.\n\nProsecutors dropped the case against a second man, Andre Stepanyan, charged over the 2022 arson attack due to insufficient evidence.\n\nIt has also been alleged that Fazal had passed on threats to Shanks and friendlyjordies producer, Kristo Langker, in 2024, demanding that the video be removed from the internet.\n\nIn a statement to NSW Police at the time, Langker said that Fazal had told him:\n\n“These people kill people. If you don’t take the video down something bad is going to happen… Jordan has already been firebombed, what more could it take to take the video down.”\n\nThe ABC reporter did not provide a statement to police and no action was taken by police against Fazal over the alleged threats.\n\nShanks released a video entitled 'They tried to kill me' , the day before the alleged text exchange between Fazal and Naumenko, in which he says of the police investigation:\n\n“When faced with an abundance of new evidence relating to the firebombing – evidence that was more than enough at the very least to charge a few people – what did the New South Wales police do? As far as I'm aware, nothing.”\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan Shanks is still receiving death threats.\n\nShanks’ lawyer Mark Davis told I A :\n\n“Since the bombing, Jordan has been on high alert because it didn’t stop with the bombing. Very blunt death threats have been made to him and his producers about what would happen if the video didn’t come down.”\n\nDavis added:\n\n“The man who delivered the threats works for 4 Corners. He says he was just passing on the messages. It deserves full investigation by the ABC — not simply about whether he received podcast money outside his contract.”\n\nWhat does it say about our public broadcaster when those in charge are more concerned about an unauthorised payment for a podcast than a member of their staff threatening to kill another journalist?\n\nWhat does it say about our legal institutions when they appear unable or unwilling to bring criminals to justice?\n\nWhat message does it send to criminals at large?\n\nMark Davis said of Shanks:\n\n“Jordan continues with his shows and to perform — he has extraordinary rigour. But it has affected his state of mind, as well as his ability to earn a living.”\n\n\n\nFollow managing editor Michelle Pini on Bluesky @michellepini.bsky.social and Independent Australia on Bluesky @independentaus.bsky.social , X/Twitter @independentaus and Facebook HERE .\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Australia License Support independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nSupport independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nRelated Articles EDITORIAL: Firebombed friendlyjordies still receiving death threats Friendlyjordies’ dangerous work met with firebombing attacks EDITORIAL: Friendlyjordies’ dangerous work met with firebombing attacks ClubsNSW’s private criminal prosecution against Friendlyjordies EDITORIAL: ClubsNSW’s private criminal prosecution against Friendlyjordies\n\nIndependent A ustralia desperately needs your help!\n\nPlease donate to our GoFundMe here\n\nGoFundMe\n\nIf you got something from this article, please consider making a one-off donation to support fearless journalism .\n\nJoin the I A newsletter for regular updates on our latest news stories.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe need YOU!

    "content": "Sussan Ley’s so-called “values test” exposes the Coalition’s desperation to court the far-Right under the guise of patriotism, writes Dr Abul Rizvi .\n\nDESPITE SAYING she wants to change the “tone” of the Coalition’s language around immigration, Opposition Leader Sussan Ley is reported to be proceeding with her idea of an Australian values test for securing a visa.\n\nThe idea is almost entirely about winning back voters the Coalition is bleeding to One Nation (or fending off MP Andrew Hastie and Senator Jacinta Price ), as it’s the kind of silly and poorly thought-out idea only a One Nation voter (or perhaps a Trumpist) would support.\n\nLey’s idea takes former Opposition Leader Peter Dutton ’s requirement for certain permanent and temporary visa applicants to sign up to an Australian values statement to the next step — an actual test.\n\nI have never heard of anyone not signing up to the Australian values statement. It hasn’t had any practical effect. Testing people on this statement is apparently going to weed out undesirable people in a way that just asking them to sign up to the values statement doesn’t.\n\nThe Federal Government would not pass its own values test The Federal Government has revamped the citizenship test by adding a “values” section, featuring principles our own government would not pass.\n\nThe Federal Government has revamped the citizenship test by adding a “values” section, featuring principles our own government would not pass.\n\nWe do require Citizenship applicants to sit a multiple-choice test, but failing the test doesn’t have many practical consequences, as the applicant remains a permanent resident. They can re-take the test at a later date until they eventually pass.\n\nBut a test for applicants for permanent residence and temporary entry visas (presumably including students, working holidaymakers, skilled temporary entrants and so on) would be a very different kettle of fish depending on the types of questions asked, the consequences of failing the test and how soon a failed applicant could re-take the test (if at all).\n\nMany people will remember former PM John Howard ’s example of asking people Bradman’s batting average as part of the Citizenship test (I am not sure that ever proceeded). Another type of question that is sometimes asked of people boarding a flight is whether they are a terrorist. Or whether they will abide by Australia’s laws. I imagine not many people answer “yes” to the first or “no” to the second.\n\nA more controversial type of question could be: What does 26 January commemorate? I recall former PM Scott Morrison once saying that 26 January commemorated the day Captain Cook landed at Botany Bay. Perhaps because he was the local member for the Botany Bay area, Morrison may have confused that day in 1770 with the day the First Fleet raised the Union Jack at Sydney Cove some 18 years later.\n\nIf the Prime Minister of Australia didn’t know what 26 January commemorates, why would we expect an applicant for an Australian visa to know that?\n\nBut let’s assume the Coalition can come up with some meaningful questions and that the costs of developing and administering the test will be covered by some sort of “user pays” arrangement. There is then a range of other practical questions that arise.\n\nFirst, will the test be run online, such that test takers can search the internet for answers or indeed use artificial intelligence? Or will the test taker have to travel to a physical location to take the test to ensure proper checking of identity and prevent them from using the internet to get the answers (as we do with English language tests, which are run by private companies)?\n\nAustralian Citizenship test revised A new Prime Minister seems like a good time for a revised Australian citizenship test.\n\nA new Prime Minister seems like a good time for a revised Australian citizenship test.\n\nHow many such physical test-taking locations will have to be established, given that Australia takes permanent and temporary entrants from every part of the world? Our embassies will often not be conveniently located or have the free space to run such tests.\n\nHow would offshore humanitarian entrants who are often in refugee camps or in war zones travel to these test locations? Would the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) or the International Organisation for Migration ( IOM ) be prepared to administer these tests? If so, who would meet the costs?\n\nSecond, would the tests be conducted in English or in other languages as well? Conducting the test in English would be fine for primary skilled applicants, but what about the spouses or children of these applicants? What about offshore humanitarian entrants? And what about partner visa applicants? Sometimes Australians marry people who do not speak English.\n\nThird, what happens if a person fails the test because they, too, were confused about some aspects of Australian history, such as our former Prime Minister was? Could that person re-sit the test at a later date, or are they forever barred? How long would the test taker be required to wait? What if the person is an onshore visa applicant? Do they get deported for being as confused as our former Prime Minister?\n\nHow long would an applicant for a partner visa have to wait before they can resit the test? Or will they have to be forever separated from their Australian partner? What about applicants for an employer-sponsored visa? Would the sponsoring Australian employers be happy about whatever further delay the Government imposes?\n\nThe reality is that an Australian values test would achieve nothing meaningful. It would create cost and delay, further clogging up an already clogged-up visa system , while pandering to the usual suspects. But that may well be the objective of the exercise.\n\n\n\nDr Abul Rizvi an Independent Australia columnist and a former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration.

    "content": "In a cruel policy move, the Trump Administration cancelled funding for World AIDS Day commemorations on the first of December.\n\nThe U.S. Government has made a formal statement to recognise those who have died of AIDS since 1988. In stark contrast, the Trump Administration instructed employees to refrain from using government funds to mark the event, or promote the day publicly.\n\nIt’s a slap in the face for people like me who are living with HIV and a huge blow to the LGBTIQA+ community. The AIDS epidemic has claimed many lives, but it’s devastated our friends and loved ones.\n\nThe epidemic has raged for 44 years with still no cure in sight. Prejudice and discrimination are rampant, and most of us are forced to conceal our HIV status. Millions of people are living with the virus, but we’re largely invisible. World AIDS Day is the only chance to shine a light on the issue, honour those who have died and have our voices heard.\n\nThe decision to cut funding and cancel World AIDS Day is not the only way the Trump Administration has kicked us in the guts. It’s part of a broader campaign to undermine the LGBTIQA+ community. We’ve been targets since they reclaimed power in 2024 and ramped up the culture wars.\n\nFrom the Acropolis to Mar-a-Lago: Trump and the ghost of Alcibiades When democracies fall, it’s not always with a bang — sometimes it’s with applause for the man who mirrors their worst selves.\n\nWhen democracies fall, it’s not always with a bang — sometimes it’s with applause for the man who mirrors their worst selves.\n\nDuring his second term , Trump has erased LGBTQIA+ and HIV content and resources from government websites, and cancelled grants for HIV prevention research. He slashed diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in workplaces, and rolled back anti-discrimination laws that protect people regardless of their sexuality or gender identity.\n\nThe human rights of people in the LGBTQIA+ community are under threat, particularly those who identify as trans and non-binary.\n\nAccording to UNAIDS , 40.8 million people are living with HIV and 1.3 million were diagnosed in 2024. Since the start of the epidemic, 44.1 million people have died of AIDS.\n\nAround 1.2 million are living with HIV in the U.S., with over 39,000 diagnoses in 2023. Cities like New York and San Francisco were “ground zero” when the AIDS epidemic exploded in the 1980s. Thousands of people died before then President Ronald Reagan showed enough courage to utter the word “AIDS”. He was content to ignore the epidemic and let people suffer horrific deaths.\n\nDonald Trump is imitating his predecessor with a bigoted response to World AIDS Day and his destructive policies are sabotaging the global HIV response.\n\nThe U.S. has been a major donor in the fight against HIV, but earlier this year it ceased contributions to UNAIDS. This accounted for 75% of international HIV funding and led to dire consequences. There have been widespread reports of clinics shutting down, people losing access to medicines and health care, and a surge in HIV transmissions.\n\nThe dismantling of HIV prevention programs for young women led to 570 new infections every day among girls aged 15-24 globally in 2024. At the same time, over 60% of community organisations led by women have suspended vital programs.\n\nKey populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, injecting drug users and transgender people have also been impacted.\n\nUNAIDS has warned that funding cuts to international HIV prevention efforts could see 3.3 million new infections in the next five years.\n\nJEFF MCMULLEN: Trump’s war within: How language became a weapon Donald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric is fuelling a volatile political divide, turning words into weapons on America’s streets.\n\nDonald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric is fuelling a volatile political divide, turning words into weapons on America’s streets.\n\nA report titled Overcoming Disruption says:\n\n‘Persistent funding shortfalls and the perilous risks facing the global HIV response are having profound, lasting effects on the health and well-being of millions of people throughout the world.’\n\nThe AIDS epidemic had slowed and the future looked promising. Infection rates were declining in many countries, including Australia, with people accessing HIV treatment and prevention. Between 2010 and 2024, annual AIDS-related deaths fell by 54% to 630,000 and new infections also dropped by 40%.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS community thought the worst was over, but the Trump Administration let us down.\n\nNow everyone is scrambling to stop the spread of HIV and prevent a catastrophe. Organisations like UNAIDS have rallied to manage the fallout from Trump’s drastic cuts.\n\nWinnie Byanyima , executive director of UNAIDS, says:\n\n“The funding crisis has exposed the fragility of the progress we fought so hard to achieve.”\n\nCancelling World AIDS Day in the U.S. will do more harm to the global HIV response. It receives little coverage in the media and it’s one day that draws public attention to the cause. World AIDS Day brings people together from the international community in a display of solidarity. It raises awareness and breaks down stigma.\n\nHIV/AIDS is still a huge public health threat and we need to remain vigilant to stop the epidemic.\n\n\n\nJames May is a freelance writer and his work has appeared in The Guardian , The Age , The Sydney Morning Herald and Canberra Times .\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Australia License Support independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nSupport independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nRelated Articles 'Turbulence' examines Australia’s role in Trump-era power plays CARTOONS: Mark David is building his ballroom The world needs Mr Trump's orange renaissance JEFF MCMULLEN: The boy with no eyes — the dangers of a new nuclear arms race Congressional Budget Office estimates of deportations will make Trump angry\n\nIndependent A ustralia desperately needs your help!\n\nPlease donate to our GoFundMe here\n\nGoFundMe\n\nIf you got something from this article, please consider making a one-off donation to support fearless journalism .\n\nJoin the I A newsletter for regular updates on our latest news stories.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe need YOU!

    "content": "Recent outcomes on poverty alleviation raise concerns about the merit of Australia’s peak welfare body, as Alan Austin reports.\n\nTHE NATIONAL welfare monitor should go the way of the Australian Press Council and ABC News , and for the same reason — no longer fit for purpose, having been co-opted by mendacious anti-Labor interests.\n\nIn a disturbing recent media release , the Australian Council of Social Services ( ACOSS ) made numerous blatantly false assertions. These included that poverty in Australia is still worsening, that poverty now afflicts one in seven people and one in six children. Current data disproves all these.\n\nIt openly accused the recently re-elected Labor Government:\n\n‘While the Albanese Government has taken some steps to reduce poverty, such as supporting minimum wage increases and small income support increases, it must do so much more to turn this trend around.’\n\nAll the evidence shows ACOSS’s criticisms were valid several years ago under the long-departed and unlamented Coalition. But not today.\n\nData shows Albo reducing poverty while welfare sector insists he isn’t Claims from Australia’s welfare peak body appear at odds with reality.\n\nClaims from Australia’s welfare peak body appear at odds with reality.\n\nBack in 2013, the Rudd / Gillard governments succeeded in increasing the single age pension above 34% of average total earnings , which ensured basic comfort for most retirees. Under the Coalition, this fell to 32.9% in 2020, then crept up to 33.5% at the 2022 Election. Yes, at those levels, thousands of pensioners had fallen back into poverty.\n\nWages then surged under Labor and so did the relative percentage of the age pension. This hit an all-time high of 34.7% in March 2023 and a fresh record of 35% in September 2023. It has remained above 34% ever since.\n\nThe single-aged pension was boosted by $1,276.60 per year in March 2024, a significant rise of 5.1%. Over that year, inflation was just 3.6%. The same happened a year later, in March this year, when the annual pension rise was another 3%, with inflation at 2.4%.\n\nThose rises ensured hundreds of thousands of pensioners were lifted well above the poverty line.\n\nOutcomes are more emphatic with the adult jobless allowance . This was above 22.5% of average total earnings for most of the Rudd/Gillard period. It tumbled during the dismal Coalition years to 21.68% in 2020, then recovered strongly after the Albanese Government won office. It climbed to 24.24% by the end of 2022, then to 26.19% a year later. It has remained above 25.3% of adult earnings since then.\n\nAs set out in detail last February, Labor has implemented at least 11 strategies to lift vulnerable Australians out of poverty.\n\nAs a result, the percentage of Australians in destitution is the lowest ever and most of those struggling are nowhere near as badly off as they were.\n\nThese are pretty important facts. ACOSS has not only refused to report them, but is conveying the opposite messages.\n\nInstances of this are interviews with the anti-Labor ABC News, and media releases which distort the reality here , here and here .\n\nBy not confirming that poverty alleviation is greater under Labor, ACOSS is useless. By implying the opposite, it is worse than useless.\n\nAustralia’s real economic challenge isn’t welfare dependency — it’s inequality Economic inequality in Australia is the worst it's been in 20 years — if the goal is to improve living standards, our leaders should be addressing it.\n\nEconomic inequality in Australia is the worst it's been in 20 years — if the goal is to improve living standards, our leaders should be addressing it.\n\nThe principal failure of ACOSS and its partner, the University of NSW , is their definition of poverty as earning less than 50% of the median household income.\n\nAs explained here in September, if the Albanese Government doubled all Australian incomes while keeping outlays the same, poverty would remain unchanged.\n\nThis is because, however high incomes were and however luxurious living standards became, the same number would remain below the median income — by definition.\n\nClearly, the methodology is ludicrous.\n\nThe other obvious failure is the grossly excessive time lags.\n\nThe October media release states:\n\n‘Using the most recent figures, researchers found 3.7 million people – 14.2% of the population – were living in poverty in 2022–23. That marked an increase from 12.4% of the population – or 1 in 8 people – in 2020-21.’\n\nThat data is far too old to be instructive.\n\nThe National Debt Helpline issued a report on the number of emergency calls it received in September on 1 October. We had to wait a full day to see whether hardship is easing or worsening. The Australian Office of Financial Management ( AOFM ) issues reports on Australia’s gross debt every Friday, current to that day.\n\nThe Bureau of Statistics issued jobs data for September on 16 October, a 16-day wait. The Finance Department issued the overall budget situation in September, including all revenue, expenditure, net debt and the progressive deficit, in its monthly release on 24 October.\n\nWith all the university research tools available, ACOSS in 2025 should be able to show the 2025 situation. Unless, of course, current data reflects well on Labor.\n\nABC News misleads on the economy and risks pushing more Australians into poverty ABC presents old data from the previous Coalition Government as a 'new' cost-of-living crisis study.\n\nABC presents old data from the previous Coalition Government as a 'new' cost-of-living crisis study.\n\nUntil ACOSS can measure real-time poverty, perhaps it should forget trying to lecture governments and focus on private providers. Here’s what they could do.\n\nA small proportion of the population is either unable or unwilling to benefit from government services, however generous they may be. These include those whose mental state, substance addiction or relationships ensure all government payments disappear before they can be spent on accommodation or food and a smaller number who refuse government aid on principle.\n\nThe Productivity Commission estimates this cohort – which it labels as in ‘persistent poverty’ – comprises 1,650 per million adult population. Currently, these number about 45,000.\n\nThese are the folks whom the private food banks and local welfare agencies exist to assist.\n\nThere is value in promoting these essential services, ensuring they feed the actual hungry rather than folks comfortably off looking for free meals and curbing their propensity to falsify the news.\n\nMaybe ACOSS could be helpful after all.\n\n\n\nAlan Austin is an Independent Australia columnist and freelance journalist.

    "content": "Antifascist combat training is about feeling safe, not tough, writes Tom Tanuki .\n\nWRITING IN Red Flag about why we should carefully consider what tactics we use when mobilising against white supremacists, Socialist Alternative’s ( SAlt ) Omar Hassan writes:\n\n'Tactics have to have the aim of making the action meaningful to those involved, helping encourage passive sympathisers to get more involved and being defensible to those not already invested in the issue.... This doesn’t necessarily prevent repression, but it makes the political cost to the authorities much higher.'\n\nI agree that the aftermath of the second March for Australia counter-rally made the \"cost to the authorities\" of state repression a bit lower. (If the cost of repression can get any lower in this climate at all, when seemingly every rally leads to more anti-democratic legislation.)\n\nAfter the 19 October anti-fascist counter-rally, there was great scrutiny on the activist left by mainstream media, politicians and the justice system. Certain protesters were observed throwing big rocks at Victorian Police (VicPol), who responded by incapacitating randoms with deadly, military-grade munitions.\n\n'March for Australia' losing numbers and strength Australia’s far-right marches have gone from working-class rage to white nationalist delusion.\n\nAustralia’s far-right marches have gone from working-class rage to white nationalist delusion.\n\nAmid the resultant media-fomented outcry, the Herald Sun shared a picture of a meme on a pre-rally Campaign Against Racism & Fascism (CARF) presentation slide suggesting that it revealed CARF, the largest group promoting and populating Melbourne’s counter-protests, was scheming to bring the big rocks. VicPol went on to declare the CBD as a \"designated area\" for six whole months, meaning they can inspect people’s bodies and personal possessions and remove their masks without a warrant for half a year. (I remember the days where one day of \"designated areas\" was considered anti-democratic!)\n\nThe aftermath suggests that the acceptable response is to freak out about rocks, while blithely accepting that weaponry like deadly stinger grenades being fired at random citizens is a reasonable public safety measure.\n\nI dislike that in the absence from the discussion of those who unilaterally elected to throw those rocks, it was groups like CARF – generally seen to the local activist left as reluctant to fall afoul of the law — left holding the bag. But Omar has taken his response to the moment much further, dismissing a variety of anti-fascist tactics he describes as \"black bloc\".\n\nThe black bloc is known for turning up to demonstrations as a distinct contingent wearing uniforms (black outfits, black hoods/helmets etc) designed to hide their identities and shield them from police attack, and with the aim of carrying out anonymous acts of violence.\n\n\n\nThese activities are justified by black bloc supporters as attacks against authority, fascism, capitalism or whatever the issue of the day may be. And unlike the regular “sheeple” who attend conventional demonstrations, creating “ banal spectacles ” within the rules, the black bloc sees itself as striking more serious blows against the system. But the truth is they do nothing to challenge the establishment, and often help strengthen it.\n\n\"Sheeple\" is an odd word to derisively deploy. That’s a (dated) word more in the domain of conspiracists than the typical black bloc proponent. This reaffirms my sense that SAlt people, bless their hearts, don’t get out much (to anything that isn’t a SAlt event).\n\nSimilarly, Omar also neglected to weigh up decent reasons to don black bloc, or even measures such as \"grey bloc\" (anonymous attire that doesn’t necessarily stand out in a uniform-like fashion like black bloc). Protecting one’s privacy against the kind of state that expands in its repression of protest all the time, for example. Or wanting to not get doxxed by fascists.\n\nBut it’s a specific set of tactics Omar is fundamentally concerned with, and thus he goes on to lump in rock-throwing with fighting fascists as acts of \"feeling tough\".\n\n“Bashing a few fascists or throwing stones at police is the very definition of performative. It is pure street theatre, a chance for small groups to feel tough and radical by acting out their pseudo-revolutionary fantasies.”\n\nThere has been some intra-left fallout over those rocks and their consequences. Those who whipped them out were said to have done so unilaterally and, I’m told, without the consent of the coalition driving the rallies.\n\nMarch for Australia organisers and thugs suffered a huge loss of numbers that day (I calculated an 85 per cent reduction). But precisely none of us got to talk about the bottom falling out of the March’s nascent nationalist movement, because we were all too busy getting lectured about \"our\" rocks.\n\nCops weren’t the strategic or relevant opponent to target that day, in my view, even if I dislike them and their repressive presence. The white supremacist rally was the target. And in fact, given the astounding loss of numbers at the second March, 19 October would have been an easy win… if certain people had just, in the words of Brown Cardigan , Done Heaps Less .\n\nBut Omar’s throwing the baby out with the bathwater, quite intentionally. And I take issue with this \"feeling tough\" thing as regards physical resistance.\n\nWhen he dismisses ‘bashing a few fascists’ , I believe he’s referring to an attempt by other activists, at the first March for Australia on 31 August, to physically prevent the National Socialist Network (NSN) from entering the space.\n\nThey had a fight. The NSN weren’t stopped.\n\nOmar clearly doesn’t see the point of this sort of thing. Allow me to \"feel tough\" for a moment, then.\n\nIf those activists had managed to stop the NSN with their hands that day – and they came closer than anyone else to doing so – then the NSN would not have been able to do what they did on 31 August. They would not have collected all the media propaganda they did, and they couldn’t have used that propaganda to recruit all the new blood they did.\n\nFirebombed friendlyjordies still receiving death threats Three years on from the firebombing of the home of Jordan Shanks, AKA friendlyjordies, an ABC Four Corners reporter has allegedly made death threats against the YouTuber.\n\nThree years on from the firebombing of the home of Jordan Shanks, AKA friendlyjordies, an ABC Four Corners reporter has allegedly made death threats against the YouTuber.\n\nA real reason to attempt stopping the NSN’s activist and propagandising activities, including with physical barriers and defence, is because the more people they recruit now, the more sizeable a fringe there will be later when disillusioned members make a move after the NSN (eventually, and in my view, inevitably) falls apart.\n\nBrenton Tarrant was among the fringe of the late-2010s patriot movement. In 2017, he was arguing that the United Patriots Front (UPF) was a ‘political movement of peace’, as I located evidence of him telling someone on Facebook that year:\n\nBy the time that movement had fallen apart, two years later, Tarrant was carrying out the largest ever mass-murder by an Australian citizen.\n\nSo we fear that it will be with the fringe of the NSN’s fringe.\n\nThat’s one reason an auxiliary movement of permanent anti-fascist activists, however niche and small, needs to exist. Yes, in concert with or in support of a broader mass movement. And, yes, sometimes deploying physical resistance.\n\nOmar wants a mass movement of passive sympathisers to join in the struggle. Me too.\n\nBut I note that what he actually said was:\n\n“Only a mass movement of the working class can seriously challenge capitalism.”\n\nNo organiser wants to lose new blood after one or two actions. But this line speaks to a regular criticism that leftists have of SAlt, which is the vibe people have that they’re mostly participating in these struggles against Nazis in order to rope people into the next Marxism Conference.\n\nIs that a reduction or an oversimplification of SAlt’s intentions? They’d probably say so. Well, so is dismissing all anti-fascist physical resistance as \"purely performative\" a nd \"feeling tough\".\n\nThere are posers around, sure. There are also people trying in earnest to deploy methods that work to stop more Christchurch massacres.\n\nOne of this lot has been charged in Canberra after detailed plans to attack a ‘commie meeting or march’ in Canberra were discovered, along with bomb materials and chlorine gas. He could well have been thinking of a SAlt meet. NSN’s professional propaganda materials are explicitly encouraging this kind of violence.\n\nIf anti-fascists are undertaking combat training right now, and they are, then Omar’s lot should think about the merits of doing the same to protect their mass movement. I want our new blood to feel safe, not \"tough\".\n\n\n\nTom Tanuki is an IA columnist, writer, satirist and anti-fascist activist whose weekly videos commenting on the Australian political fringe appear on YouTube .

    "content": "Across the nation, our culturally and linguistically diverse older population is growing faster than the systems designed to support it. Mainul Haque reports.\n\nAUSTRALIA IS STANDING on the edge of an ageing population tsunami and we are not ready for it.\n\nAcross the nation, our older population is growing faster than the systems designed to support it. Among them are culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) Australians, for whom language, faith, food, family structures, and cultural expectations remain central to wellbeing. Yet aged care continues to operate on a “one-size-fits-all” model, one that fits no one and fails too many.\n\nAs one elderly migrant recently shared:\n\n“We worked hard for Australia for all of our lives. In our old age, we just want Australia to understand us.”\n\nNearly one-third of Australians are born overseas. Many who arrived in the 1980s and 1990s are now entering their 60s, 70s, and 80s. More than one million Australians aged over 65 speak a language other than English at home. Across cities and regional centres alike, multicultural populations are growing faster than the national average.\n\nMost families have a sad story to tell about Australia's aged care system As I meet voters in the electorate of Bradfield, where I’m standing as an independent candidate in the Federal Election, I hear endless sad stories about aged care.\n\nAs I meet voters in the electorate of Bradfield, where I’m standing as an independent candidate in the Federal Election, I hear endless sad stories about aged care.\n\nThese older Australians are far from a fringe group. Many are highly educated former professionals, business owners, and skilled workers. They are financially stable, socially connected, and eager to live with dignity in environments that allow them to practise their cultural, social, and spiritual traditions for as long as possible.\n\nBut ageing changes everything. As mobility declines and dementia emerges, many will no longer be able to remain at home. As dementia progresses, people often revert to their mother tongue, making English communication increasingly difficult. Without culturally aligned support, confusion, anxiety and distress intensify,  placing immense emotional and financial pressure on families, hospitals, and the public system.\n\nThe consequences are already visible. Older Australians from CALD backgrounds experience higher rates of potentially preventable hospitalisation due to language barriers, low health literacy, social isolation, and culturally inappropriate services. Each preventable hospital admission can cost roughly $6,000 and occupy around five hospital bed-days. Hospitals across the country, already under strain, will shoulder an even heavier burden unless we act now.\n\nAged care currently costs the Commonwealth around $36 billion per year. National capital investment needs are forecast to exceed $72 billion over the next seven years just to meet baseline demand. Without innovation, these billions will continue to prop up an inefficient, reactive, crisis-driven model rather than a preventative, person-centred one.\n\nEven a conservative 15 per cent reduction in preventable hospitalisations, achievable through culturally appropriate, co-designed aged care services, could save around $500 million nationally over a decade and free more than 430,000 hospital bed-days during the same period.\n\nMulticultural communities are eager to be part of the solution, but they cannot shoulder the multi-million dollar upfront costs alone. Constructing a modern 200-bed aged care facility is estimated at around $90 million, far beyond the capacity of community groups alone.\n\nThis is where public MN private partnerships (PPPs) become transformative. By combining government support, private investment, and community engagement, PPPs can deliver high-quality, purpose-built aged-care facilities quickly, efficiently, and sustainably.\n\nA PPP-funded, co-designed 200-bed facility would not only provide hundreds of older Australians with dignity, security, and culturally responsive care, it would also serve as a replicable model for other states and territories, scaling innovation across the nation. Through careful planning and genuine co-design, PPPs ensure that facilities meet growing demand without overburdening taxpayers or community groups, proving that economic prudence and social justice can go hand in hand.\n\nMainstream aged care homes often struggle to meet basic cultural requirements: halal or kosher food, prayer spaces, bilingual staff, culturally informed dementia care, gender-sensitive services, and faith-aligned end-of-life support. These are not optional extras; they directly affect mental health, behaviour, trust, and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis is why co-design must sit at the heart of any new model. Co-design is not token consultation. It is a genuine partnership where older people, families, community organisations, faith leaders, health professionals, and policymakers collaborate from the outset to shape building design, services, workforce, food, language support, governance, and care practices. When people help design their own care environments, the result is safer, more dignified, more culturally intelligent and more cost-effective.\n\nAustralia is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation. Pilot projects can be trialled, evaluated, and refined in manageable scales before being scaled nationally. The diversity of Australia’s population reflects the future of the nation, and its long tradition of collaboration between government, community, and industry provides fertile ground for innovation.\n\nA 200-bed, PPP-funded, co-designed multicultural aged-care facility would be an important first step in helping hundreds of older Australians live with dignity, belonging, and security.\n\nIt would serve as a model of culturally responsive care that could be replicated in other states and territories to meet the growing needs of our ageing, multicultural population.\n\nAged care labor migration pathway full of 'risks' More aged care workers are required, but there are questions over the new Aged Care Labour Agreement, writes Dr Abul Rizvi.\n\nMore aged care workers are required, but there are questions over the new Aged Care Labour Agreement, writes Dr Abul Rizvi.\n\nEconomically, the benefits are substantial: conservative estimates suggest more than $24 million in annual savings or nearly $250 million over ten years through reduced hospitalisations and improved long-term outcomes. At that rate, a $90 million capital investment could be effectively recouped in just four years.\n\nBut the true benefit cannot be measured in dollars alone.\n\nIt would mean less loneliness. Less confusion. Less distress for people living with dementia. Stronger family trust. Faith-aligned end-of-life care. And the simple yet profound assurance that older Australians can age in environments where they are understood, respected, and valued.\n\nThis is not about special treatment. It is about fairness and foresight.\n\nAged care must evolve to reflect the Australia we are: multilingual, multifaith, multicultural and ageing. The ageing wave is no longer approaching. It is already here. The only question that remains is whether we choose to act with foresight or wait for a crisis to force our hand.\n\nThe solution is clear: co-design, co-fund, and co-build aged care facilities with the communities they are meant to serve now and in future and across Australia.\n\nIt is smart economics. It is good policy. And it is the right thing to do.\n\n\n\nMainul Haque OAM is a retired Australian public servant with nearly three decades of experience in government, academia, and community leadership.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Australia License Support independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nSupport independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nRelated Articles Aged care labor migration pathway full of 'risks' Aged care child rape scandal spreads to Uniting Church Most families have a sad story to tell about Australia's aged care system Tax haven exposes no financial transparency in aged care sector Coalition's neglect sickens our aged care sector\n\nIndependent A ustralia desperately needs your help!\n\nPlease donate to our GoFundMe here\n\nGoFundMe\n\nIf you got something from this article, please consider making a one-off donation to support fearless journalism .\n\nJoin the I A newsletter for regular updates on our latest news stories.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe need YOU!

    "content": "Ransomware has shifted from a disruptive nuisance into one of the most aggressive and costly cyber threats facing organisations of every size and sector.\n\nCriminal groups now operate like businesses, using sophisticated tools, layered extortion tactics, and targeted campaigns to pressure victims into paying. In this landscape, hoping not to be targeted is no longer an option; building proactive defenses is now a core business priority. Organisations that invest in prevention, visibility, and resilience are far better positioned to withstand not only ransomware but the wider spectrum of cyber threats that surround it.\n\nAt the heart of a resilient strategy is a robust approach to ransomware recovery . Rather than treating recovery as an afterthought, leading organisations design, test and refine their recovery capabilities as a first-class pillar of security. This includes creating immutable, offline, and segmented backups; preparing clean recovery environments; and establishing clear decision-making playbooks so leaders can act quickly under pressure. When recovery is engineered in advance, businesses can restore operations without capitulating to criminal demands, greatly reducing both financial impact and reputational damage.\n\nToday’s ransomware attacks rarely involve just simple file encryption. Modern campaigns often use “double extortion,” where attackers both encrypt data and steal it, threatening to leak sensitive information if the victim does not pay. Some groups escalate to “triple extortion\", adding distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or direct harassment of customers and partners. This layered pressure is designed to maximise fear and disrupt decision-making.\n\nAttackers typically gain initial access through phishing emails, exposed remote desktop services, compromised credentials, or unpatched vulnerabilities. Once inside, they move laterally, escalate privileges, identify high-value systems, and disable security controls and backups before triggering encryption. These tactics highlight why a proactive defense must cover the entire attack chain from initial entry to lateral movement and data exfiltration, not just the final encryption stage.\n\nEffective ransomware defense begins with fundamentals. Regular patch management closes known vulnerabilities that attackers frequently exploit. Strong identity and access management, including multi-factor authentication and least-privilege access, reduces the chances that stolen credentials can open the door to critical systems. Network segmentation helps contain intrusions, limiting an attacker’s ability to reach backup servers or crown-jewel data.\n\nEndpoint protection and extended detection and response (XDR) tools monitor for suspicious behavior, such as unusual file encryption patterns, privilege escalation, or remote command execution. When configured correctly, these systems can automatically isolate compromised endpoints and alert security teams before an incident escalates. Combined with secure email gateways and advanced spam filtering, these measures significantly reduce the success rate of initial compromise attempts.\n\nNo matter how strong defenses are, the possibility of a successful attack can never be fully eliminated. This is why ransomware recovery must be treated as a design principle rather than a backup checkbox. Organisations should maintain multiple backup tiers: on-site for speed, off-site for disaster resilience, and offline or immutable backups that attackers cannot alter. Backups must be tested regularly through full restore exercises, not just incremental checks, to ensure they are functional and complete.\n\nEqually important is preparing recovery environments. Clean, hardened infrastructure isolated from production allows IT teams to rebuild core services without reintroducing malware. Clear recovery runbooks, contact lists, and communication templates help teams operate decisively during an incident. Practicing these steps through tabletop exercises and technical drills builds muscle memory, so the organisation can move from chaos to coordinated action when it matters most.\n\nProactive defense also depends on rapid detection and well-orchestrated response. Centralised logging and security information and event management (SIEM) platforms aggregate data from endpoints, servers, cloud services, firewalls and identity systems. When combined with threat intelligence feeds, this data helps security teams identify indicators of compromise associated with known ransomware groups.\n\nIncident response plans should define roles across technical, legal, communications, and executive teams. During an attack, responders must quickly isolate affected systems, preserve forensic evidence, and determine the scope of compromise. Having contracts in place with external incident response firms or cyber insurance partners can provide additional expertise and resources under tight timeframes. This integrated approach enables organisations to pivot from detection to containment and recovery with minimal delay.\n\nWhile ransomware often dominates headlines, the same capabilities that defend against it also strengthen defenses against other threats such as data breaches, business email compromise, and supply chain attacks. Patch management, identity controls, segmentation and robust backups form the backbone of a broader cyber resilience strategy. Continuous security awareness training, particularly around phishing and social engineering, reduces the human risk factor across all attack types.\n\nThird-party and supply-chain risk management are also crucial. Vendors and partners with weak security can become indirect entry points for ransomware and other attacks. Conducting due diligence, setting security requirements in contracts and monitoring external dependencies help ensure that defense extends beyond the organisation’s own perimeter.\n\nUltimately, building proactive defenses is not just a technical challenge — it is a cultural and governance commitment. Leadership must treat cybersecurity as a strategic business risk, not a purely IT issue. This means allocating sufficient budget, endorsing security policies and participating in incident simulations. Clear governance structures ensure that decisions about paying ransoms, engaging law enforcement, and disclosing incidents are made thoughtfully, and in line with legal and ethical obligations.\n\nContinuous improvement is essential. Post-incident reviews, even of minor events or near-misses, should feed back into updated controls, processes, and training. Security metrics, such as time to detect, time to contain, backup restore times, and phishing simulation results, provide tangible indicators of progress and highlight areas that need reinforcement.\n\nIndependent A ustralia desperately needs your help!\n\nPlease donate to our GoFundMe here\n\nGoFundMe\n\nIf you got something from this article, please consider making a one-off donation to support fearless journalism .\n\nJoin the I A newsletter for regular updates on our latest news stories.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe need YOU!

    "content": "For decades, car ownership has been an entrenched financial burden on Australian households. Between soaring registration costs, complex insurance and rapid depreciation, the \"freedom\" of owning a vehicle often feels more like a heavy commitment.\n\nNow, a major player is fundamentally challenging this status quo: KINTO, the dedicated mobility solution from Toyota, is expanding its digital-first ecosystem, offering Australians a crucial counter-narrative to traditional vehicle finance.\n\nThe latest national expansion by KINTO, particularly in key urban centres, positions it not just as a flexible option but as a genuine form of financial and environmental disruption — a move that deserves scrutiny by any consumer concerned about the spiralling cost of living. At its core, KINTO offers multiple tiers of vehicle access: KINTO Share (hourly/daily car share ), KINTO Rent (traditional car rental ) and KINTO Flex (monthly subscription).\n\n\n\nFor many Australians, the traditional car rental model is associated with opaque fees, restrictive hours and counter queues. KINTO's approach, driven by technology, strips away this friction, addressing a core concern of the Independent Australia readership: transparency and fair pricing.\n\nBy separating the cost of access (a duration fee) from the cost of use (a per-kilometre fee), KINTO makes the total price visible and predictable. This is particularly appealing in urban environments like the inner-city hubs of Sydney and Melbourne, where car ownership is financially punishing due to parking levies and garaging expenses. The cost-benefit is clear: you pay only for the vehicle when you need it, eliminating the idle expense of ownership.\n\nIn the highly competitive environment of Melbourne car share and Sydney car share , KINTO's primary advantage is not merely convenience, but commitment. The use of the reliable Toyota fleet, predominantly hybrid models, offers an implicit promise of lower running costs and reduced environmental impact — a vital consideration for discerning consumers who value both their wallet and the planet. This focus on cleaner mobility offers a stark contrast to some peer-to-peer services that lack fleet-wide quality control and operational standards.\n\nThe engine of this disruption is the KINTO car hire app . It represents a complete abandonment of outdated paper contracts and in-person transactions. The entire process is managed via your smartphone. This self-service model is the key to KINTO’s efficiency and cost savings, which are passed on to the consumer.\n\nThis fully digital, contactless experience is a powerful tool for consumer empowerment. It removes the opportunity for last-minute hidden fees and the time wasted in a traditional rental office, issues that have long plagued the established Australian car hire sector. It is a genuine step towards a low-friction economy, where technology enforces transparency over corporate ambiguity. This model is designed for a generation that demands immediate service and expects digital tools to simplify complex transactions.\n\n\n\nThe rise of the car share model in Australia is directly linked to the country’s urban congestion and housing affordability crises. In sprawling cities, access to transport remains essential, yet owning a car is often a poor financial decision due to infrastructure bottlenecks and inflated city costs.\n\nKINTO’s multi-pronged ecosystem is designed to be highly adaptable, providing scalable solutions for different needs:\n\nIn essence, KINTO is not simply an improved rental company; it is offering a scalable utility that provides \"mobility-as-a-service.\" For Independent Australia readers, this represents a significant shift in corporate strategy: a recognition by a major automotive manufacturer that the future of transport lies not in selling steel, but in providing flexible, digitally managed access to it. It’s a solution that addresses both the personal financial pressures and the broader infrastructural challenges facing modern Australia.\n\nThe question now is whether the established automotive and finance sectors will adapt quickly enough to this new, transparent model, or if KINTO will establish itself as the dominant force providing Australians with a genuine alternative to the financial commitments of traditional car ownership. The digital keys are in the hands of the consumers.\n\nIndependent A ustralia desperately needs your help!\n\nPlease donate to our GoFundMe here\n\nGoFundMe\n\nIf you got something from this article, please consider making a one-off donation to support fearless journalism .\n\nJoin the I A newsletter for regular updates on our latest news stories.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe need YOU!

Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nLarvotto Resources has secured an exclusive option to acquire the Blockade mine, a successful historic copper operation strategically enclosed by the company’s existing Mt Isa tenements in northwest Queensland.\n\nThe 152.7-hectare Blockade mining lease, 41 kilometres east-northeast of Mount Isa, initially fed silica flux - running up to 70 per cent silica - to the Mt Isa Smelter from the early 1900s.\n\nLarvotto Resources has secured an exclusive option to acquire the Blockade mine, a historic copper operation, 41km east-northeast of Queensland’s Mt Isa mining centre.\n\nThe mine then transitioned to high-grade copper ore extraction from a shallow oxide pit mined by Mt Isa Mines in the 1980s, before the mining giant eventually walked away, leaving significant upside in unmined zones.\n\nThe Blockade project aligns perfectly with Larvotto’s vision for a regional hub-and-spoke development. It also benefits from close proximity to world-class infrastructure and the massively productive Mt Isa copper belt - home to Glencore’s flagship operation, which produces 300,000 tonnes per annum of copper cathode.\n\nPrivate vendor Kilo Copper completed about 4000m of reverse circulation (RC) drilling between 2010 and 2011, defining broad mineralised envelopes which enclose high-grade core lodes.\n\nKilo’s work confirmed that surface copper carbonates and oxide breccias overlie deeper sulphides dominated by copper sulphides including chalcopyrite and iron sulphide, with continuous minor native copper evident along strike and down-dip.\n\n‘The current known mineralisation is open in all directions and drilling to date has only tested to a depth of 100 metres.’\n\nMineralisation runs along a northwest-trending fault that dips steeply at about 70 degrees to the southwest. It sits within a slim band of actinolite schist, with tougher quartzite and greywacke rocks on either side. Drilling has only probed the system down to 100m depth, although it still appears to remain open in every direction.\n\nHistorical drilling analyses acquired from Kilo Copper’s drilling between July 2010 and June 2011 underscore the deposit’s quality and potential.\n\nLarvotto Resources managing director Ron Heeks said: “Acquiring the Blockade Mine that was previously mined for High Grade copper by Mount Isa Mines Ltd has been a strategic priority that we have pursued over several years to complement our Mt Isa portfolio. Blockade, which we surround, has the potential to form an integral part of a regional hub-and-spoke operation and serve as the basis of near-term copper production from the existing mine.”\n\nThe top drill hole from the program delivered a very respectable intercept of 71m assaying 1.63 per cent copper and 484 parts per million (ppm) cobalt from 29m, including 37m going 2.48 per cent copper and 604ppm cobalt from 29m.\n\nThe second best hit gave up 70m at 1.36 per cent copper and 397ppm cobalt from 72m, with an included 10m at 3.21 per cent copper and 953ppm cobalt from 73m.\n\nThe third best copper intercept of the program came from a 12m intercept going 4.31 per cent copper and 54ppm cobalt from 14m, within a broader run of 26m at 2.36 per cent copper and 89ppm cobalt from 5m depth.\n\nThree top cobalt assays from two separate holes included 7m at 1075ppm, which included 3m grading 1119ppm in one hole, while a second hole delivered 2m going at 1081ppm cobalt.\n\nLarvotto plans to immediately kick off diligence drilling, with a targeted six-hole program of about 1500m of RC drilling to validate Kilo’s hits, extend mineralisation northwest along strike, scout parallel faults and chase deeper sulphide copper mineralisation below 100m vertical depth.\n\nResults, which are expected to be delivered early in the first quarter of next, will feed preliminary resource modelling to firm up the $1 million acquisition cost to be funded by cash and/or shares - at Larvotto’s choice - following a $400,000 exploration commitment. The initial acquisition cost will be topped up with further production- based payments, capped at $10M.\n\nIf validated, Blockade could fast-track Larvotto’s Mt Isa presence from green-fields to a near-term producer, complementing its flagship Hillgrove antimony-gold project in New South Wales.\n\nThe company recently found itself in headlines after rejecting a US$723M (A$1.1 billion) takeover bid from US antimony processor, United States Antimony Corporation.\n\nLarvotto believed the offer vastly undervalued its NSW Hillgrove gold-antimony project with 1.7 million ounce gold equivalent resource and a feasibility economics study, which, from its mid-case pricing scenario, delivers an average annual EBITDA of $250M over an 8.2-year mine life.\n\nWith copper prices holding strong amid global supply strains and Blockade sitting in the heart of Australia’s premier copper province, Larvotto’s low-capex entry looks ready to position the company for scalable growth in a Tier-1 district.\n\nThe company’s fast-tracked validation drilling could rapidly convert the historical high-grade drill hits into a modern resource to deliver another potential spoke in the company’s emerging Mt Isa hub-and-spoke production strategy and shine a new spotlight onto Mt Isa’s next copper chapter.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

    "content": "We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nThe hunt for a Brisbane Lions’ dynasty to rival that of the early 2000s will begin without three of their premiership heroes, but champion defender Harris Andrews insists a new dawn beckons.\n\nAs the senior members of the two-time defending premiers returned to Brighton Homes Arena to launch their preseason, the next generation of stars to don the maroon, blue and yellow were setting about forging their own destinies.\n\nEven Australian sprint sensation Gout Gout was in attendance, completing a training session at the club’s indoor facility as he fixes his gaze on conquering the world ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nJaspa Fletcher, Oscar Allen and Daniel Annable will all lace up for the Lions in 2026. Credit: Getty\n\n“I could not be further away from moving like Gout Gout,” Andrews laughed.\n\n“He does a bit of stuff in the kick room and that sort of thing, it’s very impressive to see how explosive he is. I don’t think I’ll try jumping in on any training like that, I have a shocking running style, but it’s very impressive, and he’s a pretty unbelievable athlete.”\n\nFor a squad now deprived of Brandon Starcevich (West Coast), Callum Ah Chee (Adelaide) and Oscar McInerney (retirement) from the men who lifted the 2025 AFL trophy, there are holes suddenly to fill.\n\nBut Andrews was confident the baton would be passed to a gaggle of contenders who would not deter the Lions’ quest for a ‘three-peat’, one that would put them in the same company of the famed 2001-03 sides under the tutelage of legendary Leigh Matthews.\n\nThe fact Brisbane snared former Eagles captain Oscar Allen to replace Ah Chee in the forward line is a massive indicator of how coach Chris Fagan’s outfit have become one of the destination clubs of the competition.\n\nEssendon big man Sam Draper has also joined the fold, with the 2017 No.1 draftee pick looming as the ruck replacement for McInerney. The recruited pair arrived last week and had gruelling fitness sessions under the Queensland sun.\n\nAlready the 26-year-old Allen, who missed most of the 2025 season after undergoing knee surgery while still recovering from calf and Achilles issues, has made an impression on Andrews and the role he could play in nurturing rising young forwards Logan Morris, Kai Lohmann and Ty Gallop.\n\nThe Eagles’ Oscar Allen will join the Lions next season. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images\n\n“It’s obviously disappointing to lose Cal, but he’s got to look after his family at the same time, and he’s a little bit closer to home [in Western Australia] which is important,” Andrews said.\n\n“I wouldn’t go as far as to say we’re the destination club of the AFL, but we’ve definitely been able to do a good job over the last five years of getting some really high-quality recruits. Oscar was the captain of West Coast, so I’ll certainly be picking his brain a little bit about leadership, and he’ll offer a lot in that space to us.”\n\nOther additions to the Den have included highly touted draftee Daniel Annable, with the No.6 pick seeking to force his way into a midfield boasting Lachie Neale, Hugh McCluggage, Josh Dunkley and Ashcroft brothers Will and Levi.\n\nAlready he has caught Andrews’ eye, who lauded the teenager as “super fit, very skillful and a really great football brain”, who would thrive with the motivation of “trying to knock some of the older guys off their perch”.\n\nAs for replacing Starcevich, who missed large chunks of 2025 with concussion, rising star Jaspa Fletcher will take on a more senior role once he heals from shoulder surgery – a task he was embracing alongside wounded teammate Jarrod Berry (shoulder).\n\nFinishing with a career-best campaign for disposals (575 at 21.3 a game), inside 50s (68 at 2.52) and rebound 50s (91 at 3.37) after finding a home in the backline, Fletcher was adamant he had other gears to reach.\n\n“It’s a different challenge for me and something I haven’t quite experienced coming back from an operation. [But] I’m looking forward to it, and I’ve got a great mate in Bez beside me to get me through,” Fletcher said.\n\n“I was pretty proud of my year, but I know I can get better. Post my operation I was looking to 2026, I’ll be trying to attack my rehab as best I can and get my body ready to go – I’m able to run now which is nice.”\n\nAndrews said Starcevich would be a hard man to replace.\n\n“He’s one of the all-time great teammates to play with – so tough and resilient down there – and we’ll obviously miss his ability to lock down on really dangerous small forwards,” he said.\n\n“But at the same time, I think he missed maybe 13 or 14 games last year and ... we were able to work our way through that. When guys unfortunately leave, other guys step up.”\n\nCopyright © 2025",

Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nQueensland GPs can now diagnose and prescribe medication for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, saving patients hundreds of dollars, in a move described as life changing for people living with the condition.\n\nQueensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls announced last month that GPs would be able to diagnose and manage the treatment of adults with ADHD – a condition marked by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity – with the changes to come into effect from December 1.\n\nNicholls said almost 1000 GPs had enrolled for additional training to deliver ADHD care, from a cohort of 9000, since the announcement was made.\n\nQueensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls announced the changes to ADHD care for adults at the RACGP conference in Brisbane last month. Credit: RACGP\n\n“That’s a phenomenal result and shows just how much this service is both needed and how seriously GPs take the delivery of these services,” Nicholls said.\n\nADHD affects an estimated 1 million Australians, including more than 530,000 adults.\n\nQueensland GPs have been able to diagnose and treat children aged between four and 17 with ADHD since 2017.\n\nUntil now, adults seeking diagnosis have had to visit a specialist, usually a psychiatrist, with a referral from a GP.\n\nSuch specialist appointments can cost upwards of $1000 and incur waiting periods of up to a year, making care inaccessible for many people.\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) estimates the new reform will save patients between $500 and $1400 a year in out-of-pocket expenses and expedite diagnoses.\n\nThe move has not been without criticism. A Brisbane-based GP who spoke to this masthead on the condition of anonymity said the process to identify ADHD was based on “vague inclusion criteria”, which could lead to a surge in false diagnoses.\n\nThey also expressed fears the change could trigger a potentially unethical rise in health experts providing diagnosis – and access to drugs – for payment.\n\n“It’s being sold as a cheaper option to come and see a GP, but the market will absolutely adapt, so the GPs will then charge more because it’s a sought-after service,” they said.\n\nBeyondGP director Dr Carmel Toole said that GPs were trained to recognise ADHD and often had more in-depth relationships with their patients than psychiatrists did. But she said the success of the scheme was dependent on access to training.\n\n“It’s complex for all parties concerned and training is vital,” Toole told 4BC Mornings.\n\n“I think GPs and psychiatrists alike, while welcoming the ease of access for patients, are concerned about quality care in the absence of training.\n\n“I’d like the general public to take a bit of a deep breath and allow their GPs time to find their feet with this and to access training.”\n\nNicholls said the scheme would be monitored in line with other states introducing similar changes.\n\n“This hasn’t been done overnight. This has been done through collaboration over a lengthy period of time,” he said.\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nStrickland Metals has unearthed thick, high-grade gold at its Kotlovi prospect, which forms part of the company’s massive 7.4-million-ounce Rogozna gold and base metal project in Serbia.\n\nThe company says mineralisation has now been defined across several drillholes at the prospect, which currently stretches across a strike of 300m and remains open in all directions.\n\nCore photograph illustrating sulphide rich breccia at Strickland Metals’ Kotlovi prospect, part of the company’s Rogozna gold and base metals project in Serbia.\n\nStandout hits included a high-grade 14-metre slice grading 4.1 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 2.4 g/t silver within a broader 34.9-metre intersection running at 2.2g/t gold and 2.4g/t silver.\n\nAnother drillhole intersected two thick zones of skarn mineralisation including 14m grading 1.4 g/t gold from 318m and 24.8m at 0.7 g/t gold from 352m.\n\n‘Kotlovi is continuing to shape up as an important new discovery at Rogozna.’\n\nSitting just 350m west of the company’s huge 1.28-million-ounce Medenovac gold equivalent deposit, management believe there is a real possibility Kotlovi and Medenovac may be connected. Although the structures are separated by a large quartz diorite intrusion, both appear to share the same skarn mineralisation.\n\nKotlovi was first discovered 12 months ago after Strickland tested a coincident multi-element soil anomaly and an induced polarisation anomaly. The drill bit went on to jag a whopping 40.3m intersection grading 2.6g/t gold, including 12m at 5.7g/t gold from regional exploration scout drilling.\n\nThe company then backed up that discovery hole with a diamond drilling program in August, which returned exceptional gold hits of 277.3m grading 1.3g/t gold equivalent, including multiple higher-grade zones of 33.5m grading 2.9g/t gold and 8.8m at 4.7g/t gold.\n\nStrickland Metals managing director Paul L’Herpiniere said: “Kotlovi is continuing to shape up as an important new discovery at Rogozna, with the potential to make a significant contribution to the project’s overall growth trajectory. These latest drill results have further expanded the known mineralisation, which now extends over a 300m strike length.”\n\nKotlovi makes up just one cog in the wheel of the company’s huge Rogozna gold and base metal project. Seven rigs are currently humming away across the wider project area as part of a 50,000-metre budgeted programme of diamond drilling for 2025. Assay results for the recently completed holes are expected to be released in coming weeks.\n\nThe Rogozna project lies in the heart of Serbia’s Trepca mineral district, one of Europe’s largest base metal mining centres. Access to the project area, which lies 400 kilometres south of Belgrade, is made easier by the many highways and well-maintained roads in the region.\n\nSerbia is Europe’s second largest copper producer and is a well-regulated, established mining jurisdiction with a modern mining code. Last year, the country signed a deal with the European Union to create a strategic partnership for the supply of critical minerals used in batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nSeveral other major global mining companies also have significant gold and base metal projects in country, including BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale, Zijin Mining, Kinross Gold and Dundee Precious Metals. Serbia has a highly skilled workforce and excellent infrastructure, as well as a highly favourable fiscal regime.\n\nAcquired for $37 million in 2024, Rogozna benefits from Serbia’s 15 per cent tax rate and mining-friendly policies.\n\nStrickland’s Rogozna project has the potential to become one of the largest undeveloped gold and base metal deposits in the world. No doubt multiple discovery opportunities and resource upgrades from its Shanac and Gradina prospects will likely keep the company extremely busy. However, the exciting possibility of merging Medenovac with Kotlovi as one large deposit is now likely to become a key focus in its resource development plans for 2026.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Credit: TGA\n\nThe TGA’s search of its Database of Adverse Event Notifications for GLP-1 RA medicines on September 23 retrieved 85 reports, including 72 for suicidal ideation, six for depressional suicide, four for suicide attempt, two for suicide and one of self-injurious ideation.\n\nIts investigation included seeking advice from an independent expert group, the Advisory Committee on Medicines, which in June reported that there was insufficient evidence of a causal link between the medicines and suicidal ideation or behaviours.\n\nBut the advisory committee found there was a “complex interplay between mental illness and chronic endocrine disorders” (which GLP-1 RAs may be used to treat) and “the potential relationship between weight loss and suicidal or self-harm ideation”.\n\nIt noted that the product information across this class of medicines was inconsistent and should be “harmonised”. It recommended updating the safety advice after taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of doing so, including validating community concerns and the potential risks of causing undue alarm where evidence is lacking.\n\nMounjaro’s product warning will also be updated after the TGA’s investigation found the drug’s potential to render oral contraception less effective “could not be ruled out”.\n\nA 2024 review included one study that found tirzepatide reduced the amount of ethinylestradiol (synthetic oestrogen in the combined oral contraceptive pill) in the bloodstream by 20 per cent. Five other studies did not show a statistically or clinically significant difference.\n\nAnother study found that tirzepatide increased the time it took the ethinylestradiol to be fully absorbed into the bloodstream from two to four hours, which could be due to the drug’s effect of slowing stomach emptying because ethinylestradiol is mostly absorbed in the small intestine .\n\nPatients will now be advised to switch to non-oral contraception or use a barrier method (such as condoms) for contraception for four weeks after first taking the medication and for four weeks after increasing the dose.\n\n“None of the GLP-1 RAs should be used during pregnancy, and individuals of childbearing potential are advised to use effective contraception during treatment with a GLP-1 RA,” the alert reads.\n\nThe British medicines regulator issued advice in August to all individuals of child-bearing age to ensure they do not become pregnant while taking GLP-1 RAs because there is not enough safety data to know whether they can cause harm to fetuses. The regulator received more than 40 reports of unintended pregnancies by women using the drugs.\n\nOzempic owner Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro, have been contacted for comment.\n\nIf you or anyone you know needs support, call Lifeline 131 114, Beyond Blue 1300 224 636, or PANDA between 9am and 7.30pm on 1300 726 306.\n\nMake the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our Live Well newsletter .

Please try again later.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nThe life of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant could be extended for a second time as NSW Premier Chris Minns flagged he was open to a deal to avoid blackouts if the plant shuttered before the grid could cope.\n\nEnergy experts declared on Monday the electricity grid would not be ready for Eraring, the nation’s largest coal-fired power station, to shut down by its scheduled end date in mid-2027. The warnings came after the Australian Energy Market Operator said there would be a heightened risk of blackouts from the time when Eraring is set to close.\n\nA generation unit at Origin Energy’s Eraring coal plant, during scheduled maintenance work.\n\nOfficials are increasingly worried that, while there are enough renewables and power lines under construction to replace coal plants, there will not be enough infrastructure to prevent sudden blackouts by maintaining a safe and stable electricity flow.\n\nMinns on Monday gave his strongest indication that his government was willing to work with Origin Energy, which owns Eraring, on a deal to delay its planned closure date.\n\n“We are not necessarily opposed to a conversation with them about it,” Minns said.\n\nSuch a deal is expected to require taxpayers to provide a guarantee worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year if the Eraring plant is required to keep running at a loss.\n\nThe state government offered in 2024 to cover potential losses of Eraring, valued at up to $225 million a year, in a deal to ensure Origin ran the plant past its former 2025 closure deadline. Origin agreed to the deal but did not activate it as it made money in a favourable energy market.\n\nWhile Origin has not activated that deal, there is an option for it to kick in from 2027 until 2029, but the terms have not been written.\n\nEnergy expert Matt Rennie, at Rennie Advisory, said the grid would not be able to cope in the short term without Eraring.\n\n“We need to pay proper regard to the reality that coal will come out of the system at some point, and therefore the preparation for the new energy system is absolutely critical,” Rennie said.\n\nMacquarie Equities infrastructure analyst Ian Myles said market watchers are already factoring in Eraring’s closure being deferred under another agreement with the NSW government.\n\n“My expectation is, and we’ve modelled this, that Eraring will be operational until 2029. That is probably a common expectation [across markets],” he said.\n\nGrattan Institute senior fellow Tony Wood said it was likely Eraring would need to stay open beyond 2027, but bill payers would bear a cost even if AEMO advised there was an option to function without the plant.\n\n“Even if the grid limps along without Eraring, there’ll be costs, and what would annoy me if I lived in NSW is the question: who’s going to pay for all this?”\n\nAEMO said on Monday that NSW grid owner Transgrid is racing to install new equipment to keep the grid stable, but that equipment is unlikely to be delivered until “at least 2028”.\n\nTo run smoothly, power grids must not only match supply and demand, but also maintain “system security”, including inertia, which comes from the steady frequency traditionally provided by the spinning turbines of gas, coal and pumped hydro plants.\n\nGood system security enables the grid to ride through sudden spikes or lulls in demand, power line faults or power plant breakdowns.\n\nMost of Australia’s coal plants are scheduled to retire by 2035, while soaring maintenance costs and competition from renewables are driving owners to speed plans for closures.\n\nAEMO has warned that the loss of inertia and system strength from the scheduled closure of Origin’s Eraring coal plant in 2027 would create a heightened blackout risk in NSW.\n\nIf Eraring does close in 2027, another option to keep the grid stable would be to secure extra supply from gas or hydropower to meet minimum system strength requirements, the cost of which would be ultimately borne by bill payers.\n\nNSW government was aiming to speed up Transgrid’s installation of synchronous condensers – grid-connected machines that don’t burn fuel but deliver the same stabilising effects as the spinning turbines of coal and gas plants.\n\nMinns said his government this year passed new laws to fast-track synchronous condensers, “a crucial piece of infrastructure”.\n\nHe also said despite warnings that the extension would slow down the rollout of renewable energy, NSW was number one in the country for renewable energy investment.\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the federal government was getting on with building the renewables grid as Opposition Leader Sussan Ley warned that “this government’s energy policy has not recognised that you need baseload generation in the system for as long as it takes to transition to affordable renewable alternatives”.\n\nOrigin has said it would not close Eraring if there was a need to keep it running.\n\n“Origin has always acted responsibly in this regard, and the community should have confidence we will continue to do so,” a spokesperson said.\n\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

The initiative is led by the Duke-NUS Centre for Outbreak Preparedness.\n\nAsia PGI brings together more than 50 government and academic partners across 15 countries, with Singapore as its nerve centre.\n\nE-paper\n\nNewsletters\n\nPodcasts\n\nRSS Feed\n\nAbout Us\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nNeed help?

If you are one of them, here is what you need to know.\n\nA: Wait times along the entire CCL will be longer during the three months.\n\nShuttle trains will ply the stretch between Mountbatten, Dakota and Paya Lebar stations, operating at 10-minute intervals from a single platform at these stations due to the tunnel closure.\n\nTrains along the rest of the CCL will turn around at Paya Lebar and Mountbatten stations.\n\nWhen that single platform is occupied by a shuttle train, incoming trains must wait for it to depart before they can turn around . This waiting process will have an impact on the whole CCL, resulting in longer intervals between trains.\n\nAt the 20 stations between HarbourFront and Paya Lebar, peak-hour train frequency will increase from the current two minutes to about three minutes.\n\nThere will be a longer wait of 10 minutes between trains from Mountbatten towards the Dhoby Ghaut or Marina Bay stations, from six minutes now.\n\nLTA has said that passengers may want to avoid the stretch between Mountbatten and Paya Lebar, and use other bus and rail connections instead.\n\nA: Shuttle bus services will kick in from Jan 5 , so that passengers can familiarise themselves with alternative travel routes , LTA said.\n\nServices will ply routes between several stations on the CCL during peak hours to ferry passengers to stations not affected by the works. These services will follow the same fare structures as the trains.\n\nShuttle bus service 37A will ferry passengers from Serangoon station to Tai Seng, MacPherson and Paya Lebar stations, and will operate at three- to five-minute intervals from 7am to 9am.\n\nShuttle 38 is a two-way shuttle bus that will operate between Paya Lebar, Dakota, Mountbatten and Stadium stations every six to 10 minutes, to augment shuttle train services. It will operate from 6.30am to 9.30am.\n\nShuttle bus service 37B will take passengers from Tai Seng to Bishan, and will run every three to five minutes from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.\n\nShuttle bus service 37C from Tai Seng to Serangoon will operate at three- to five-minute intervals from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.\n\nShuttle 38 will operate from 5pm to 8pm on the same route as the morning service.\n\nA: If you are travelling during morning and evening peak periods, it may be faster and more convenient to travel on other MRT routes to avoid crowded stretches on the CCL.\n\nFor example, passengers travelling from the north-east region on the North East Line (NEL) to one-north, Kent Ridge or Buona Vista can transfer to the Circle Line at HarbourFront, instead of making the transfer at Serangoon.\n\nThis journey from Serangoon to one-north would take about 45 minutes. The same journey on the CCL would take about 58 minutes, factoring in the longer waiting time and crowded trains.\n\nThose travelling from the north-east to Buona Vista and farther west towards Clementi and Tuas Link should take the NEL to Outram Park station, where they can transfer to the East-West Line (EWL) to Buona Vista and westwards, towards Tuas.\n\nThe journey from Serangoon to Clementi during the weekday peak on the NEL and EWL is expected to take about 47 minutes, compared with about 65 minutes on the CCL, where the intervals will be longer.\n\nLTA said passengers should expect CCL interchange stations, such as Bishan, Serangoon and Buona Vista, to be crowded during the morning and evening peaks .\n\n“During these periods, additional waiting time could extend to up to 30 minutes compared with typical travel times,” LTA said.\n\nDuring the evening peak period, passengers boarding at Tai Seng and Bartley stations , which tend to have a higher volume of passengers, will have to wait longer to board trains.\n\nPassengers at Tai Seng and Bartley are advised to take the CCL to Paya Lebar, and transfer to the EWL to Buona Vista and beyond. The estimated travel time between Tai Seng and Buona Vista stations is 47 minutes using the CCL and EWL, versus 61 minutes on the CCL.\n\nFor those travelling outside the morning and evening peak periods, the crowd situation is expected to be manageable, even with longer intervals between train arrivals throughout the day.\n\nA: The tunnels were built in soft marine clay, which gradually compresses and can cause the circular tunnel to become more elliptical – or oval-shaped – with the passage of time. This process is known as “tunnel squatting”.\n\nAssociate Professor Raymond Ong, from the department of civil and environmental engineering at the National University of Singapore, said tunnel squatting can lead to structural defects in the tunnel if left unaddressed. These can include the leakage of water through joints and the deterioration of concrete.\n\nLTA said there were already minor defects in tunnels affected by tunnel squatting, such as signs of water leakage, which were fixed by using grouting to seal the leaks. Grouting is a construction method that entails filling voids or cracks with a dense fluid mixture.\n\nProfessor Chu Jian, chair of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University , said tunnel squatting, if unaddressed, may lead to severe disruptions that will have a worse impact on passengers than a planned, three-month service adjustment.\n\n“If it is left untreated, it may lead to a much bigger scale of repair, or even... affect the safety of the MRT operation,” Prof Chu said.\n\nA: Yes, the CCL remains safe to use, and consultants engaged by LTA have confirmed that train operations can continue safely while the strengthening works are carried out.\n\nA: The installation of steel plates requires heavy equipment, specialised machinery and multiple work teams, LTA said.\n\nMore than 300 workers and engineers will be deployed, supported by engineering wagons and locomotives equipped with robotic arms and cranes.\n\nBecause of the scale and complexity of the works, extended engineering hours are needed, and LTA opted to close the tunnels in turn, so that works can be carried out around the clock.\n\nIt is a complicated process, as workers must ensure that the live components of the railway systems are not inadvertently damaged, said Prof Ong.\n\nMr David Ng, chairman of the civil and structural engineering technical committee at the Institution of Engineers , Singapore, said it is impractical for the works to be done during regular engineering hours, which last three to four hours a night.\n\nHe added that the tunnel works should be carried out when the defects are still minor. Otherwise, “the deformation might become worse, and (the) structural capacity of the tunnel lining will be affected,” he said.\n\nProf Ong said that if the tunnel works were to be carried out during regular engineering hours, a huge amount of time will be wasted on logistics, such as the movement of people and heavy equipment in and out of the tunnels. This would lead to the repairs taking much longer.\n\nHe said the key challenges of this work will be related to logistics, as heavy machinery and hundreds of workers need to move from entry points, such as depots, to the locations where the repair is to be done.\n\nProf Chu said working underground in “very congested areas with many buildings above and utilities nearby in the ground” also has its challenges.\n\n“The space available for operation is very limited, and any operation has to ensure that (any) effect on the adjacent buildings or facilities (is) kept to the minimum,” Prof Chu said.\n\nProf Ong said the three-month expected duration for the tunnel works “is well within the range of expectation”, given the complexity of the tasks at hand.\n\n“We need to adopt the understanding that such repairs are required for the longevity of the system,” he said.\n\nVanessa Paige Chelvan is a correspondent at The Straits Times.

Minor defects such as water leaks have already surfaced.\n\nAlthough there is no immediate safety risk, not addressing these defects in the tunnel structure could lead to severe service disruptions, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Dec 1.\n\nAt three months, this will be one of the longest planned MRT service disruptions so far.\n\nDuring this time, shuttle trains will run on a single platform at 10-minute intervals connecting Mountbatten, Dakota and Paya Lebar stations. This is up from the current three-minute frequency.\n\nshuttle trains will run on a single platform at 10-minute intervals\n\nPassengers will need to switch to another train at Mountbatten or Paya Lebar to continue their journey on the CCL.\n\nThere will be slightly longer waits between trains along the entire length of the CCL during this period.\n\nThe 20-station stretch between HarbourFront and Paya Lebar will see peak-hour intervals rise from two to three minutes. Train intervals between Mountbatten and the Dhoby Ghaut and Marina Bay stations will also go up, from six to 10 minutes.\n\nAn average of 480,000 passengers will be affected each day.\n\nAcknowledging that the tunnel works “will cause some inconvenience”, LTA advised commuters to factor in more waiting time .\n\nPassengers should expect CCL interchange stations, such as Bishan, Serangoon and Buona Vista, to be crowded during morning and evening peak periods.\n\n“During these periods, additional waiting time could extend to up to 30 minutes compared with typical travel times,” LTA said.\n\nPassengers may also want to avoid the stretch between Mountbatten and Paya Lebar, and use other bus and rail connections instead, it said.\n\nSeveral shuttle bus routes will also operate during peak hours to provide alternative connections between various stations not affected by the works.\n\nThis will start on Jan 5, about two weeks before the start of the tunnel closure, so that passengers can familiarise themselves with alternative travel routes , LTA said.\n\nSixty-two shuttle buses will be deployed for a start, LTA said, adding that it would monitor demand and make adjustments if needed.\n\nThose travelling during morning and evening peak periods may find it faster and more convenient to travel on other MRT routes, avoiding crowded stretches on the CCL, LTA said.\n\nFor example, passengers travelling from the north-east region on the North East Line (NEL) to one-north, Kent Ridge or Buona Vista can transfer to the CCL at HarbourFront, instead of making the transfer at Serangoon.\n\nThe CCL comprises 33 stations, 30 of which are in operation. The remaining stations – Keppel, Cantonment and Prince Edward Road – are expected to open by June 2026. LTA said it aims to complete the tunnel works before the opening of the remaining stations.\n\nThe tunnels connecting Mountbatten, Dakota and Paya Lebar stations will be closed one at a time to allow the installation of steel plates , LTA said. This affected 450m stretch also includes a portion of the tunnels between Stadium and Mountbatten stations.\n\nThese plates will reinforce the circumference of the tunnels, which were built in soft marine clay that gradually compresses over time. This can cause the circular tunnel to become more elliptical or oval-shaped in a phenomenon called “tunnel squatting”.\n\nLTA said its expert consultants have confirmed that train operations can continue safely while the strengthening works are carried out.\n\nDr Goh Kok Hun, its group director of infrastructure design and engineering, said: “We have carried out engineering assessments and confirmed that the tunnels remain safe for rail operations.”\n\nMinor defects, such as water leaks, had cropped up in the tunnels more prone to squatting, LTA said. These leaks have been sealed by grouting , a construction method that entails filling voids or cracks with a dense fluid mixture .\n\n“While we have addressed these issues, we decided to carry out precautionary strengthening works to reduce the risk of affecting rail services if left unaddressed,” LTA said.\n\nThe authority said it has been monitoring the situation over the past decade, and had started studying possible long-term solutions in January.\n\nLTA noted that this issue is not unique to Singapore, and said that cities such as Shanghai, Taipei, Busan, Barcelona and Lisbon have encountered similar challenges and adopted comparable solutions.\n\nThe installation of steel plates requires heavy equipment, specialised machinery and multiple work teams. More than 300 workers and engineers will be deployed, supported by engineering wagons and locomotives equipped with robotic arms and cranes.\n\nBecause of the scale and complexity of the works, extended engineering hours are needed, and LTA opted to close the tunnels in turn, so that works can be carried out around the clock.\n\n“We cannot rule out the need for further works, as tunnel squatting is the result of geological processes,” it added. “We will continue to monitor the tunnel and ground to ensure they have stabilised even after works are completed.”\n\nPassengers can refer to LTA’s MyTransport.SG mobile app and social media platforms, as well as those of CCL operator SMRT, for more information.\n\nLTA said it will also conduct roadshows and engage the public at some CCL stations and key transport points before the service adjustments start.\n\nPosters and announcements will be rolled out at all CCL MRT stations and selected stations on MRT lines that interchange with CCL stations, LTA said.\n\nStation staff will also be deployed at affected stations to help passengers , especially seniors and those with mobility issues.\n\nThanking the public for their understanding, Dr Goh said the works will “maintain the safety and reliability of our rail system for the long term”.\n\nSimilar tunnel works were conducted on the CCL in 2023 along the tunnel section between Promenade and Nicoll Highway stations , affecting services at seven stations . As the area is built on reclaimed land, the LTA said tunnels along this stretch had been “subject to greater pressure”. The service adjustments lasted about two weeks .\n\nPromenade and Nicoll Highway stations\n\nIn November, Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow said Singapore’s rail network will see more planned closures lasting longer to allow major MRT upgrades.\n\nSingapore’s rail network will see more planned closures\n\nThe current nightly maintenance window of about 3½ hours leaves only around two engineering hours, after factoring in the time needed to deploy and extract heavy equipment, which is insufficient for substantial works, he said.\n\nAn international panel of rail experts had also recommended extending scheduled shutdowns of network segments, so critical maintenance and renewal projects can be completed safely and efficiently.\n\nVanessa Paige Chelvan is a correspondent at The Straits Times.

It was so surreal watching Sana sing the melodies born out of my room in Singapore. That was the moment I knew I had to take a shot at my dreams. If not now, then when?”\n\nThat moment convinced Ms Daina to take a leap of faith. She quit her job in April and committed to writing songs for Asian artistes full-time, under her moniker Dainasaurs .\n\nAfter watching Mirage – a song that she co-wrote – performed by singer Sana from Twice at the Tokyo Dome, Ms Daina Ariffin committed to writing songs for Asian artistes full-time.\n\nPHOTOS: DAINA ARIFFIN, JYP ENTERTAINMENT\n\nHer latest works include Rock & Roll by K-pop girl group Itzy, from their second full-length Japanese album Collector released in October. The song peaked at No. 3 on the Oricon chart, a Japanese music popularity chart.\n\nMusic has long been part of Ms Daina’s life. As a child, she was always humming in class or on the school bus. At nine, she entered a singing competition at the now-closed Hong Kah Primary School on a whim and won the title of Hong Kah Idol.\n\nAt Ngee Ann Polytechnic , where she studied mass communication, Ms Daina joined the a cappella club. She received vocal training, performed in various projects and studied artistes such as Little Mix and Britney Spears.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, she began posting covers of songs from Conan Gray and Red Velvet on social media, while pursuing a professional communication degree offered by RMIT University and taught at Singapore Institute of Management.\n\n“During the pandemic, I was bored out of my mind and had so much time on my hands. I thought of using this time to hone my singing-songwriting skills and tried putting out my covers,” said Ms Daina, who plays the guitar.\n\nHer talents caught the attention of music makers such as South Korean composer INFX, and they started collaborating on demo songs.\n\nWithin about half a year of posting covers, she was invited to take part in online songwriting camps, where producers and writers gather to create new tracks based on specific briefs.\n\nThis marked her foray into freelance songwriting, co-writing tracks for Chinese singer Jane Zhang and Thai girl group MXFRUIT.\n\nStill, she was hesitant to tell her loved ones about her desire to pursue music as a career.\n\n“I was scared that my friends and family would not take me seriously. People will say, ‘How far can you go pursuing that in Singapore?’” she said.\n\n“I didn’t know if my family would accept that, and I would be crushed if they did not.”\n\nIn her work, Ms Daina Ariffin is involved in writing the melodies, lyrics and concepts for songs, as well as recording the vocals.\n\nPHOTO: DAINA ARIFFIN\n\nIn 2023, South Korean music publisher Jam Factory flew her to Taiwan for her first in-person songwriting camp.\n\nA long-time fan of K-pop boy group NCT, she was excited to try working in the genre. She now regularly shuttles between Singapore and Seoul to collaborate with South Korean songwriters, even though she does not speak or write Korean . Many songs are first written in English before being translated or adapted for Asian artists.\n\nHer big break came when she was introduced to Los Angeles-based songwriter and producer Sean Alexander , known for his work with K-pop acts Exo, Twice and Girls Generation.\n\nThrough Zoom sessions, they co-wrote Mirage for Sana – with Mr Alexander producing the track and Ms Daina writing the melodies, lyrics and concept, and singing the demo.\n\nShe said: “I was inspired to write a magical, whimsical concept about being put under a spell of love, and that’s how Mirage was born. Inspiration comes from everywhere: from daily life to movies and imagining what it is like living as a different person. There is no limit to creativity, and that’s what I love most about being a songwriter.”\n\nThe industry, however, is far from easy, Ms Daina said. The K-pop songwriting scene is dominated by American, Swedish and Dutch writers.\n\n“At the time that I started, there was more demand for songwriting skills for K-pop songs from outside of Singapore. I kept working on my craft and wanted to prove myself and make it as a Singaporean creative on the global stage,” she said.\n\nNetworking is a crucial part of her job, and “Instagram is like our LinkedIn”, she quipped.\n\nRejection is constant in her job.\n\n“You need to have thick skin, but at the same time, be self-aware of the quality you put out. You can write dozens of songs before one gets picked. Even then, artistes can drop it later. I’ve learnt to manage my expectations and celebrate the wins,” she said.\n\nHer father and mother, who are self-employed and an administrative assistant respectively, were initially worried about the financial uncertainty.\n\n“None of my family are big music fans so they don’t understand what I do exactly and the gravity when big K-pop acts like Itzy and Sana pick up my songs. I convinced my mum that it was sustainable after showing her what I earned,” she said.\n\nAs a freelance songwriter, Ms Daina earns performance royalties , which are typically distributed annually or semi-annually.\n\nEarlier in her career, she sometimes accepted buyouts – the “selling” of one’s stake in a composition – offered by publishers or music labels.\n\nMs Daina hopes to eventually write for her dream artistes Ariana Grande and K-pop acts Aespa, BTS and Nmixx, as well as expand her catalogue.\n\nOne of her long-term ambitions is to compose a National Day Parade (NDP) song.\n\n“I would love to write an NDP song one day because that was such a huge part of my childhood and it’s something quite special and exclusive to Singapore,” she said.\n\nIn 2026 , she will be teaching songwriting at K-pop training academy SM Universe (Singapore) . It is a subsidiary of SM Entertainment, one of the “Big Four” K-pop agencies.\n\nSM Universe (Singapore)\n\nBesides writing for others, she hopes to write, sing and release her own music.\n\nMs Daina said she enjoys taking the unconventional path, while many of her peers pursue marketing and advertising careers.\n\nHer job has broadened her worldview, allowing her to collaborate with musicians around the world to put out music on a global scale.\n\n“Don’t be afraid to tell your family and friends about your dreams. It’s okay to feel scared and embarrassed, it’s part of the process,” she said.\n\n“You have to put yourself out there. The only reason I got here is because I wasn’t embarrassed to put myself out there, even though I’m not perfect.\n\n“Don’t wait around, you have to seize the moment.”\n\nE-paper\n\nNewsletters\n\nPodcasts\n\nRSS Feed\n\nAbout Us\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nNeed help?

She was one of more than 23,000 travellers who were caught and fined a total of $7,114,850 from January to October 2025, said the Singapore Customs in a media release on Dec 1.\n\nThese travellers were caught across air, land and sea checkpoints and fined for not declaring dutiable and taxable goods brought into Singapore.\n\nThe amount meted out in the first 10 months of 2025 was more than double the $3,471,043 imposed over the same period in 2024. In the same period in 2023, $2,303,380 was imposed.\n\nThe total number of travellers caught from January to October 2025 wa s 23,742 , up from 13 ,099 in 2024 and 7,139 in 2023 over the same period.\n\nSingapore Customs, which works with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to conduct checks and deter violations, said 142 offend ers in 2025 received the maximum penalty of $5,000 for making incorrect or incomplete declarations. This was more than three times the 46 cases in 2024 and 51 in 2023.\n\nOne of the offenders who received the maximum $5,000 fine was a woman arriving from Bangkok on Oct 17 who was caught with undeclared new luxury items including a bag, a wallet and three pieces of jewellery.\n\nA Singapore Customs spokesperson said evading payment of duties or goods and services tax at checkpoints is a serious offence and the agency will take firm action against all offenders.\n\nCommon violations involved commercial goods such as machinery parts and renovation materials, apparel and accessories including bags and mobile phones, consumer goods such as health and skincare products, and cigarettes and alcohol. Offenders who were found trying to bring in items intended for commercial purposes included a man who was stopped at the Singapore Cruise Centre on July 31 with 544 pieces of assorted fishing lures and was fined $1,130, and a man who was caught at Woodlands Checkpoint with several rolls of furniture laminate, and was fined $250.\n\nIn another case, a man at Woodlands Checkpoint on Oct 9 failed to declare 11 bundles of T-shirts he was delivering to companies in Singapore and was fined $2,990.\n\nBundles of T-shirts that were undeclared by the traveller at Woodlands Checkpoint.\n\nPHOTO: SINGAPORE CUSTOMS\n\nAll goods brought into Singapore remain subject to GST, and those who attempt to fraudulently evade duty face fines of up to 20 times t he amount evaded or jail of up to two years, said Singapore Customs.\n\nThe agency reminded travellers that they must truthfully declare and pay applicable duties or GST for items that exceed their import reliefs and duty-free allowance.\n\nTravellers can make advance declarations through the Customs@SG web application or use the Customs Declaration Kiosks on site.\n\nE-paper\n\nNewsletters\n\nPodcasts\n\nRSS Feed\n\nAbout Us\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nNeed help?

Most flash floods here do not last for more than an hour.\n\n“I think there is still a sense maybe that flash floods should not even happen in Singapore. But with climate change, from time to time, we can expect flash floods to happen,” he said, in his first media interview since he took over the reins of the agency in late 2023.\n\n“We want to get to the stage where (a flash flood) is not such a shock as and when it happens,” he added. But a lot more work is needed to build the resilience of the populace, and the first thing is to adjust the public’s mindsets about flash floods here, Mr Ong noted.\n\nMr Ong was formerly the deputy secretary of resilience at the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, overseeing water and food policies between 2021 and 2023. In that role, he also covered communications, partnerships and engagement at the ministry.\n\nPUB recognises the need to build up residents' resilience against flash flooding.\n\nPHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO READER\n\nThat experience, he said, taught him that climate action requires inputs from all of society.\n\nMr Ong noted that investment in improving Singapore’s drainage system remains a key pillar of flood prevention . It was announced in February that $150 million will be spent on drainage upgrading works in the 2025 financial year.\n\n$150 million will be spent on drainage upgrading works\n\nBut with land constraints, there is a limit to how much more drainage can be built or expanded here, he added.\n\nPUB has also undertaken the construction of more specialised flood-proofing infrastructure, Mr Ong said, citing the recently completed Syed Alwi Pumping Station, which features an underground tank in the low-lying Jalan Besar area.\n\nrecently completed Syed Alwi Pumping Station,\n\nIt diverts storm water from Rochor Canal into an underground tank to prevent the area’s drains and canals from overflowing during a deluge.\n\nUpgrading works on a 900m stretch of the Bukit Timah Canal, between Rifle Range Road and Jalan Kampong Chantek, are scheduled to be completed in 2026.\n\nST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\n\nStill, despite governmental efforts, residents , businesses and commuters in flood-prone areas also increasingly have to keep an eye on weather forecasts and flood alerts, and take steps to be out of the water’s reach, Mr Ong said.\n\nCurrently, PUB uses a few channels to update the public on potential flash flooding, including social media platform Telegram and vehicle on-board units.\n\nBut Mr Ong said the national water agency will continue to invest in new ideas to provide more accurate and far-reaching early warnings to the public.\n\nFor example, PUB announced in mid-November as part of its annual flood awareness campaign that it is working on tapping mobile phone signals to better predict places that may get intense rainfall.\n\nThis project, done with StarHub and water management solutions provider Hydroinformatics Institute, is targeted for completion by the end of 2025, with potential for islandwide implementation .\n\nWhen it rains, rainfall can interfere with cellular signals sent between telecommunication towers . These interferences can be tapped to estimate rainfall intensity. With how ubiquitous mobile phones are, this data can augment the information from rain gauges located islandwide, said Mr Ong.\n\ninterfere with cellular signals sent between telecommunication towers\n\nPUB also said in November that it will work to integrate flood alerts into Google Maps and gradually install 650 more water level sensors islandwide by 2028 .\n\nflood alerts\n\ninto\n\nGoogle Maps and gradually\n\n\n\ninstall 650 more water level sensors\n\nA contractor, accompanied by a PUB officer, measuring the length of a water level sensor cable after testing its accuracy next to a drain in Bukit Timah Road on Nov 25.\n\nST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\n\nPUB also started an annual flood awareness campaign in November 2024, as the country entered the rainy season. In its second run now, the focus is on educating the public about precautions they can take to avoid being caught in flood waters.\n\nAsked what such action could look like, Mr Ong said: “If you’re a landed (property) owner, you put out barriers. If I’m a commuter, I adjust my plans. I don’t walk out into the heavy rain and risk being caught in a flood. If I’m a driver, I avoid the flooded area that I’m notified about, or I choose not to drive right now. To me, that’s resilience.”\n\nProtecting Singapore’s coastlines from rising sea levels caused by climate change is also a relatively new area for PUB, with the agency designated in 2020 as the nation’s coastal protection agency.\n\nUnder Mr Ong’s tenure, PUB has done more public outreach on sea level rise and floods – from a series of community dialogues where participants could suggest coastal protection measures, to meetings where residents brainstormed ideas to better prepare for floods.\n\n“The coast belongs to so many people. There are residents, there are companies, there are fishing enthusiasts, there are nature groups. And everybody would want some say into how they reimagine our coasts,” he acknowledged.\n\nFor example, taking in the feedback of Changi residents and nature groups, PUB proposed to construct a raised platform – such as a bund – farther inland of Changi Beach Park to ensure continued access to the beach and preserve the seagrass-rich shores.\n\nproposed to construct a raised platform\n\nClimate change could also put pressure on PUB’s primary role in the country – safeguarding Singapore’s water supply, Mr Ong said.\n\nOf Singapore’s four main sources of water, two are exposed to the elements, making them vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. They include imported water from Malaysia – up to 250 million gallons a day from the Johor River – and Singapore’s 17 reservoirs.\n\nThe agreement for Singapore to import raw water from Malaysia expires in 2061. There is also limited space in the country to build new reservoirs.\n\nTwo other sources of water, NEWater and desalination, are more climate-resilient and are expected to provide a larger share of the local water supply in the coming decades, said Mr Ong. NEWater is produced by recycling and purifying used water and is currently mainly used for industrial processes and air-conditioning cooling purposes.\n\nThe country’s water demand is now about 440 million gallons a day. By 2065, this could nearly double, with the non-domestic and industrial sector accounting for about 60 per cent of water consumption.\n\n“NEWater is essentially dependent on its input, the amount of used water that is generated by households and companies. As water demand goes up, the potential for more NEWater also goes up,” explained Mr Ong. “Where we can, we will maximise this source as much as we can,” he added.\n\nDesalination – the process of producing drinking water from the ocean – is more expensive and energy-consuming, and its use will not be ramped up unless necessary, said Mr Ong.\n\nHomes still have some way to go to reduce water use to meet the national target of 130 litres per person a day by 2030 , as charted out in the Singapore Green Plan . In 2024, household water consumption crept up slightly, with each resident using 142 litres of water a day , up from 141 litres in 2023.\n\nusing 142 litres of water a day\n\nPUB’s chief highlighted three trends that are making it trickier to shave off the 10 to 12 litres – hotter weather, working from home and smaller household sizes.\n\n“The same population split into smaller households would see greater water use. Once you have a household, there is a certain fixed water usage,” he explained.\n\nThe trend of flexible work arrangements post-pandemic diverts water use to homes, and with rising temperatures, residents would drink more and take more showers to beat the heat.\n\nMr Ong added: “These three trends are pushing up against our target... We continue to push towards the 130-litre target as best as we can.”\n\nSingapore had a water price hike recently, when the price per cubic metre rose by 50 cents in total across 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhen asked if water price is set to increase further amid climate change pressures on the resource, Mr Ong said: “Have you ever seen water price come down?”\n\n“From PUB’s perspective, it’s important for us to recover the cost of producing water. We do need to (also) collect enough revenue so that we can continue to invest in future water infrastructure that we need,” he added.\n\nWith rising water demand, more infrastructure is needed, and that will come at additional costs. Mr Ong said: “We do take a long-term perspective to this... and that will mean water price increases from time to time.”\n\nShabana Begum is a correspondent, with a focus on environment and science, at The Straits Times.\n\nE-paper\n\nNewsletters\n\nPodcasts\n\nRSS Feed\n\nAbout Us\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nNeed help?

(Photo: Yang Yi)\n\nThis audio is generated by an AI tool.\n\n“We have to open the sliding door because Shu Qi doesn’t like aircon,” said a PR minder just a few minutes before our interview with the 49-year-old actress-turned-director.\n\nA murmur of acknowledgment spread throughout the group of journalists, all suddenly giddy with excitement that they’ve become privy to this unknown fact about Shu Qi.\n\nShu Qi doesn’t like aircon. Who knew?\n\nIt would be one of the few personal things 8days.sg would learn about the Taiwanese star during the chat. Prior to the interview, we were told and reminded to keep our questions strictly related to her directorial debut, Girl.\n\nThe coming-of-age film, set in the late ’80s, follows an introverted girl trying to escape her abusive parents. The movie, which stars teen actress Bai Xiaoying, actor Roy Chiu and singer 9m88, is partly based on Shu Qi’s traumatic childhood. It nabbed her the best director award at the Busan International Film Festival in September.\n\nGirl was also the opening film of the Singapore International Film Festival, which was why we were sitting in a room on the 10th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel – with an awesome view of the SuperTrees and Gardens by the Bay – waiting to speak with her.\n\nShu Qi didn't so much enter the room as she glided into it. She was followed by her posse of photogs, hair and make-up people, her manager and more minders. Joining her were Bai Xiaoying and 9m88.\n\nShe took a seat on the couch and smiled at the group of us normal-looking folks. She was, if you’d ever imagined meeting her, heartbreakingly beautiful in person.\n\nOf course someone had to ask her about not liking air-conditioning.\n\n“Oh it’s not that. I just don’t like the draft,” said Shu Qi.\n\nOh .\n\nCorrection: Shu Qi doesn’t not like aircon. She just doesn’t like the draft that comes with it.\n\nEarly in the interview, Shu Qi rose to close the sliding door that had been opened just for her. She said she was concerned that the sounds of traffic below might be too noisy and distracting.\n\n“Is this better now?” she asked.\n\nThe film draws inspiration from Shu Qi’s own traumatic childhood. When asked how she managed to move past those experiences, she explained that it isn’t something one truly gets over. Rather, it’s something you slowly learn to live with.\n\nShe shared how, like the titular character, she used to hide in her wardrobe to escape her abusive parents.\n\n“That’s why I have very serious claustrophobia,” she said. “I don’t dare to take elevators. I don’t dare to live on high floors. But I have to take planes and elevators every day… I know nothing will happen, but the fear inside is undeniable. Still, you have to step [into the lift]. You have to reach your destination. And you realise that you can do it.”\n\nShe paused, then slipped into an exaggerated elderly voice as she imagined her future self: “Maybe when I’m very, very, very old… I’ll go, ‘Aiyah, I’ve been through so much… it’s nothing. What was I even scared of last time?’”\n\nWhen we asked Shu Qi if there was another part of her life she thinks could make a great story for the big screen, she deftly sidestepped the question by shifting the spotlight to her friends instead.\n\n“I think beyond my own life, many of my friends’ stories could also be explored and adapted,” she said. “Lately, I’ve been thinking more about women’s issues – their bodies, their inner worlds, their place in society – but still within the context of family.”\n\n“I think the next one would be set in a more modern era. Filming this movie, which takes place in the ’80s, was really too tough. We spent so much time and effort recreating the period, and along the way, a lot of time was wasted. So I would want to make things simpler.”\n\nWhat about romance? Would she ever make a film about love, we asked.\n\nShu Qi, who is married to Hong Kong actor-director-heartthrob Stephen Fung, paused for a moment, pursing her famously plump lips as she pondered the question. Then she broke into a smile.\n\n“You’re so happily in love now,” we prodded gently.\n\nShe laughed, then turned thoughtful.\n\n“As an artiste… Director Hou Hsiao-hsien once told me that we have a certain influence on society, and we should use it to do something positive. We should use whatever medium we have to spread things that are beneficial, things that can help people get out of difficult situations. So when Director Hou asked me to make this movie, I thought about how childhood experiences affect a family.”\n\nAs for love?\n\n“Um… it doesn’t really have much to do with my life now. I still want to write about women’s issues. Love… I’ll leave that to the younger people. I don’t think I can act in romance shows anymore.”\n\nWhy not?\n\nShe burst into laughter.\n\n“’Cos I’m old already.”\n\nThis story was originally published in 8Days.\n\nFor more 8Days stories, visit https://www.8days.sg/\n\nSubscribe to CNA's Recommended Read\n\nA single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

VinFast, Vietnam's  largest carmaker by sales, does not break down foreign market sales. A Vingroup affiliate is fast expanding Vietnam's EV charging network. PARTIAL SHIFT FROM FULL-EVs REEVs, like hybrids, use two power sources, an electric motor and an ICE, but unlike hybrids, the ICE does not drive the car in REEVs. It only recharges the battery when needed, extending driving range. VinFast stopped producing petrol-fuelled cars and shifted to electric vehicles in 2022. That year, it also joined the COP26 declaration on green transition for cars, pledging to sell exclusively zero-emission vehicles in leading markets by 2035 and globally by 2040. REEVs produce emissions, but usually less than plug-in hybrids. Reuters could not establish whether VinFast plans to develop REEV technology in-house or acquire it. \"There is no change to our overall strategy,\" Vingroup said, adding official details would come \"at the appropriate time\". In 2023, VinFast held nearly 80 patents, far fewer than Tesla's 347 patent families or the thousands held by the major traditional carmakers, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. Chinese electric carmakers, including Li Auto and Leapmotor, produce REEVs, while legacy automakers are developing similar options.

(File photo: CNA/Lan Yu)\n\nSINGAPORE: From Jan 1, 2026, motorists can have their composition fines reduced by S$30 (US$23) if payment is made within 14 days from the date of the notice of traffic offence, the traffic police said in a news release on Monday (Dec 1). The Early Payment Scheme will apply to locally registered vehicles that have committed traffic offences attracting composition fines of S$50 or more.\n\n“The scheme aims to encourage motorists to pay their composition fines promptly and reduce meritless appeals”, the police said.\n\n“This will save the Traffic Police significant resources, and allow these resources to be reallocated to more critical areas such as enforcement.” Composition fines are issued for traffic offences that do not require prosecution in court. These include stopping in a yellow box, making an unauthorised U-turn and exceeding the speed limit by up to 40kmh. In 2024, the traffic police issued an average of around 6,000 notices of traffic offence and processed more than 1,000 appeals per month.\n\n“The vast majority of the appeals were rejected as the Traffic Police only accedes to appeals in exceptional circumstances, such as if there was a medical emergency, and with supporting documentary proof,” the police said.\n\nMotorists will be notified of their eligibility for the early payment scheme through the notice of traffic offence. If payment is received within 14 days of the notice, motorists will qualify for the S$30 reduction.\n\nAfter 14 days, the full composition fine will apply and there will be no extension of the deadline.\n\nGet our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\n\nStay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\n\nGet WhatsApp alerts\n\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\n\nCopyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "content": "Search\n\nThe levies are part of the US president’s aggressive “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on about 90 nations, with rates as high as 50% on some partners\n\nShare\n\n[AUSTIN] The United States is calling in a favour from friends like Singapore as President Donald Trump tries to rebalance the American economy and restore “fairness” to the international trading system.\n\nTrump’s ambassador to Singapore, Dr Anjani Kumar Sinha, offered that explanation when asked how the US President’s 10 per cent baseline tariff on the Republic, in spite of a free trade agreement since 2004, aligns with the broader goals of the US-Singapore relationship.\n\n“Over many decades, American taxpayers and service members have underwritten regional security, playing an important role in making Singapore’s economic miracle possible,” he said in an e-mail interview with The Straits Times (ST).\n\n“Now, we are asking our friends to help us rebalance the economy. That’s the framework, and I am confident the US-Singapore business and economic relationship will continue to grow,” he said.\n\nThe levies are part of Trump’s aggressive “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on about 90 nations, with rates as high as 50 per cent on some partners. They are intended to help reduce the US trade deficit, which stood at more than US$1 trillion in 2024, revive manufacturing in the American hinterland, secure better market access for US goods and strengthen US supply chains.\n\n“President Trump’s trade agenda is focused on restoring balance and fairness to the international trading system and protecting US national security,” Dr Sinha said.\n\nSingapore, however, is among the countries with whom the US enjoys a trade surplus that partly helps offset large deficits it has with partners like China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union.\n\nThe US goods trade surplus with Singapore was US$1.9 billion, while the services trade surplus was US$25.1 billion in 2024, as per the US Trade Representative’s office.\n\nThe higher US tariffs are dampening global economic prospects, including Singapore’s gross domestic product growth, which is expected to ease into a range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent in 2026 after expanding at around 4 per cent in 2025 and 4.4 per cent in 2024.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nSingapore’s key exports, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, remain vulnerable to sectoral tariffs. Trump has imposed 100 per cent tariffs on branded drugs, but these are on hold to allow the administration to negotiate deals with companies. Sectoral tariffs for semiconductors are yet to be announced.\n\nDr Sinha, who has named technology, energy and security as some of his priority areas, expressed confidence that the business and economic relationship with Singapore would continue to grow.\n\n“We continue to work with Singapore to find ways to strengthen cooperation on trade and investment, and to promote economic growth in both of our countries, and I continue to work with American companies to advocate for US exports,” he said.\n\nAn orthopaedic surgeon who set up successful clinics in New York, Dr Sinha became the first Asian-American and the first medical doctor to be tapped by a US president as Singapore ambassador. Born and educated in India, he immigrated to the US in 1977. His wife, Dr Kiki Sinha, is a retired anaesthesiologist.\n\n“I feel very much at home,” he said of his posting. “The region is familiar to me, including the warm way I’ve been welcomed by the Singaporeans I’ve met so far, and I understand the mix of cultures and histories here.”\n\nOn whether he sees scope for collaboration that helps boost Singapore’s status as a medical hub, he said he had met the leadership of different hospitals to explore possibilities.\n\n“Singapore offers first-rate medical care with some of the latest American technologies, so I want to make sure American companies and workers can continue to export our medical devices and pharmaceuticals to Singapore. I also want to make sure the US remains the partner of choice for graduate medical education and medical research for Singapore’s physicians,” he said.\n\nAsked if he has spoken to US pharmaceutical companies based in Singapore on the matter of tariff exemptions on their products exported from Singapore to the US, he declined to comment. ST understands that there are no updates on the ongoing discussion.\n\nAnother promising avenue for cooperation is energy. Nuclear power is a key pillar in Trump’s energy “dominance” agenda, while Singapore is keen to build its suite of low-carbon energy strategies.\n\nIn 2024, the US and Singapore signed a 30-year agreement that will allow the Republic to better access the latest nuclear technologies and scientific research from American organisations to further its low-carbon energy strategy.\n\n“I know that Singapore is still evaluating these options, but I’m excited about the many potential energy opportunities that, I believe, will benefit both Singapore and the US,” Dr Sinha said.\n\nDr Sinha is also the first ambassador that Trump has appointed to Singapore. During Trump’s first term, the ambassador’s post remained vacant and the US Embassy in Singapore was led by a charge d’affaires.\n\nAs a political appointee, Dr Sinha can be expected to have Trump’s ear. He reportedly plays golf with Trump and is his son Donald Trump Jr’s orthopaedic surgeon.\n\nWhile declining to confirm these links, Dr Sinha said he had known Trump for more than 15 years and called him a “wonderful friend”.\n\nAsked what was Trump’s message to him as he took up this assignment, he said he had been tasked to drum up economic ties.\n\n“Before I left for Singapore, he told me two things: represent our country well, and increase our economic and commercial ties. I took that to heart and will be focused on deepening our US-Singapore economic relationship, which is already so strong,” he said.\n\nWhile facing questions from the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations during his confirmation hearing, Dr Sinha came in for some criticism over his lack of diplomatic experience and his understanding of the region and Singapore’s strategic role.\n\nDr Sinha, who is in his 70s, said he had taken it in his stride. “My friends and I have smiled over that moment often over the past few months,” he said, adding that he is a lifelong learner and has a team of experts by his side at the US Embassy.

    "content": "Search\n\nMost flash floods here do not last for more than an hour\n\nShare\n\n[SINGAPORE] With climate change expected to cause more erratic rainfall patterns, Singapore’s approach to dealing with flash floods has been expanded, said national water agency PUB chief executive Ong Tze-Ch’in.\n\nThe government will continue to invest in drainage infrastructure, but on top of that, PUB recognises the need to build up societal resilience against flash flooding, he added.\n\n“We have come to the realisation that we cannot possibly prevent every flooding event,” said Ong, 50, in an interview with The Straits Times on Nov 28, as the country enters the rainy north-east monsoon season – the wettest period of the year.\n\nAccording to Singapore’s third national climate change study, the growing amount of planet-warming gases in the atmosphere is expected to bring heavier, more intense and frequent storms.\n\nIn January, monsoon surges – weather events that happen during the wet phase of the north-east monsoon – dumped large amounts of rain over the country in a short period of time.\n\nThe first surge episode in early January led to a nearly three-hour flood in Jalan Seaview in Mountbatten, caused by the confluence of high tides and prolonged rain. Most flash floods here do not last for more than an hour.\n\n“I think there is still a sense maybe that flash floods should not even happen in Singapore. But with climate change, from time to time, we can expect flash floods to happen,” he said, in his first media interview since he took over the reins of the agency in late 2023.\n\n“We want to get to the stage where (a flash flood) is not such a shock as and when it happens,” he added. But a lot more work is needed to build the resilience of the populace, and the first thing is to adjust the public’s mindsets about flash floods here, Ong noted.\n\nOng was formerly the deputy secretary of resilience at the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, overseeing water and food policies between 2021 and 2023. In that role, he also covered communications, partnerships and engagement at the ministry.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nThat experience, he said, taught him that climate action requires inputs from all of society.\n\nOng noted that investment in improving Singapore’s drainage system remains a key pillar of flood prevention. It was announced in February that S$150 million will be spent on drainage upgrading works in the 2025 financial year.\n\nBut with land constraints, there is a limit to how much more drainage can be built or expanded here, he added.\n\nPUB has also undertaken the construction of more specialised flood-proofing infrastructure, Ong said, citing the recently completed Syed Alwi Pumping Station, which features an underground tank in the low-lying Jalan Besar area.\n\nIt diverts storm water from Rochor Canal into an underground tank to prevent the area’s drains and canals from overflowing during a deluge.\n\nStill, despite governmental efforts, residents, businesses and commuters in flood-prone areas also increasingly have to keep an eye on weather forecasts and flood alerts, and take steps to be out of the water’s reach, Ong said.\n\nCurrently, PUB uses a few channels to update the public on potential flash flooding, including social media platform Telegram and vehicle on-board units.\n\nBut Ong said the national water agency will continue to invest in new ideas to provide more accurate and far-reaching early warnings to the public.\n\nFor example, PUB announced in mid-November as part of its annual flood awareness campaign that it is working on tapping mobile phone signals to better predict places that may get intense rainfall.\n\nThis project, done with StarHub and water management solutions provider Hydroinformatics Institute, is targeted for completion by the end of 2025, with potential for islandwide implementation.\n\nWhen it rains, rainfall can interfere with cellular signals sent between telecommunication towers. These interferences can be tapped to estimate rainfall intensity. With how ubiquitous mobile phones are, this data can augment the information from rain gauges located islandwide, said Ong.\n\nPUB also said in November that it will work to integrate flood alerts into Google Maps and gradually install 650 more water level sensors islandwide by 2028.\n\nPUB also started an annual flood awareness campaign in November 2024, as the country entered the rainy season. In its second run now, the focus is on educating the public about precautions they can take to avoid being caught in flood waters.\n\nAsked what such action could look like, Ong said: “If you’re a landed (property) owner, you put out barriers. If I’m a commuter, I adjust my plans. I don’t walk out into the heavy rain and risk being caught in a flood. If I’m a driver, I avoid the flooded area that I’m notified about, or I choose not to drive right now. To me, that’s resilience.”\n\nProtecting Singapore’s coastlines from rising sea levels caused by climate change is also a relatively new area for PUB, with the agency designated in 2020 as the nation’s coastal protection agency.\n\nUnder Ong’s tenure, PUB has done more public outreach on sea level rise and floods – from a series of community dialogues where participants could suggest coastal protection measures, to meetings where residents brainstormed ideas to better prepare for floods.\n\n“The coast belongs to so many people. There are residents, there are companies, there are fishing enthusiasts, there are nature groups. And everybody would want some say into how they reimagine our coasts,” he acknowledged.\n\nFor example, taking in the feedback of Changi residents and nature groups, PUB proposed to construct a raised platform – such as a bund – farther inland of Changi Beach Park to ensure continued access to the beach and preserve the seagrass-rich shores.\n\nClimate change could also put pressure on PUB’s primary role in the country – safeguarding Singapore’s water supply, Ong said.\n\nOf Singapore’s four main sources of water, two are exposed to the elements, making them vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. They include imported water from Malaysia – up to 250 million gallons a day from the Johor River – and Singapore’s 17 reservoirs.\n\nThe agreement for Singapore to import raw water from Malaysia expires in 2061. There is also limited space in the country to build new reservoirs.\n\nTwo other sources of water, NEWater and desalination, are more climate-resilient and are expected to provide a larger share of the local water supply in the coming decades, said Ong. NEWater is produced by recycling and purifying used water and is currently mainly used for industrial processes and air-conditioning cooling purposes.\n\nThe country’s water demand is now about 440 million gallons a day. By 2065, this could nearly double, with the non-domestic and industrial sector accounting for about 60 per cent of water consumption.\n\n“NEWater is essentially dependent on its input, the amount of used water that is generated by households and companies. As water demand goes up, the potential for more NEWater also goes up,” explained Ong. “Where we can, we will maximise this source as much as we can,” he added.\n\nDesalination – the process of producing drinking water from the ocean – is more expensive and energy-consuming, and its use will not be ramped up unless necessary, said Ong.\n\nHomes still have some way to go to reduce water use to meet the national target of 130 litres per person a day by 2030, as charted out in the Singapore Green Plan. In 2024, household water consumption crept up slightly, with each resident using 142 litres of water a day, up from 141 litres in 2023.\n\nPUB’s chief highlighted three trends that are making it trickier to shave off the 10 to 12 litres – hotter weather, working from home and smaller household sizes.\n\n“The same population split into smaller households would see greater water use. Once you have a household, there is a certain fixed water usage,” he explained.\n\nThe trend of flexible work arrangements post-pandemic diverts water use to homes, and with rising temperatures, residents would drink more and take more showers to beat the heat.\n\nOng added: “These three trends are pushing up against our target... We continue to push towards the 130-litre target as best as we can.”\n\nSingapore had a water price hike recently, when the price per cubic metre rose by 50 cents in total across 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhen asked if water price is set to increase further amid climate change pressures on the resource, Ong said: “Have you ever seen water price come down?”\n\n“From PUB’s perspective, it’s important for us to recover the cost of producing water. We do need to (also) collect enough revenue so that we can continue to invest in future water infrastructure that we need,” he added.\n\nWith rising water demand, more infrastructure is needed, and that will come at additional costs. Ong said: “We do take a long-term perspective to this... and that will mean water price increases from time to time.” THE STRAITS TIMES\n\nDecoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

A case conference has been scheduled for Dec 2, at 9.30 am.\n\nIn his affidavit, Rai said that the group – which operates vehicle leasing, rental and fleet management businesses – is now encountering difficulties as its expansion had not been matched by demand for its services. He also cited increased operating costs.\n\nThe group intends to propose a scheme of arrangement to creditors to restructure its debts and continue its business while honouring the arrears.\n\nRai added that he is “confident that a scheme of arrangement is a sustainable alternative to an insolvent liquidation, as it can reverse Autobahn’s financial plight without prejudicing its creditors”.\n\nThe document also named the group’s creditors. DBS is key creditor, with the group owing the bank a total of S$94.8 million. Motor loan company Teck Wei Credit is owed S$70 million;\n\nOCBC , UOB, Toyota Financial Services and major car dealerships Borneo Motors and Komoco Motors were also listed as creditors.\n\nThere are now a total of 18 companies represented in the action, including the nine originally named in the letter to creditors issued on Nov 25.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nThese nine companies are: Shariot, Autobahn Rent A Car, Ah Tan Car Repairs, Bayfront Autohub, Hamilton Capital, Hamilton Autohub, Hamilton Autobahn, Shinsei Rent A Car and RS Carz.\n\nThe new entities are: Hamster Car Rental, 88 Auto, WJ Car Rental, We Rent The Car, Rabbit Car Rental, Rising Sun Nippon Corporate, HJ Car Rental, Thundercarz and Rentzilla.\n\nAll are private limited companies, except for RS Carz, which is a partnership.\n\nRai’s affidavit said: “Each of the companies forms an integral part of the wider Autobahn group operational ecosystem, and their operations are deeply interconnected.”\n\nIt explained that enforcement against a single entity would cripple the others, as vehicles, hirers, financing lines, workshop operations, IT systems and administrative functions overlap across the group.\n\nThe group’s present difficulties came to a head when it received a cancellation notice from its fleet insurer on or around Nov 26, stating that all policies would be cancelled unless arrears were paid. The insurer also said it would notify the Land Transport Authority.\n\nWithout insurance, the group’s vehicles would be unable to operate legally, leading to “defaults under all fleet financing and hire-purchase facilities, enabling lenders to repossess vehicles, enforce mortgages, and accelerate loan obligations”.\n\nThe group also received notice that its banks were considering freezing or restricting access to operating accounts, which would cause its operations to cease and trigger “multiple defaults”.\n\nThis, the affidavit said, would result in devastating consequences and “undermine the proposed restructuring”.\n\nThe group “significantly expanded” its fleet after the Covid-19 pandemic as it had anticipated an increase in demand, but this did not materialise. It was also saddled with rising costs over time.\n\n“(Certificate of Entitlement) premiums increased, insurance premiums escalated, maintenance costs rose, and inflation affected parts, labour and workshop operations,” the affidavit said.\n\nDBS is owed a total of around S$94.8 million from eight of the companies, while Eazy Insurance is a creditor of 12 of the companies, and it is owed about S$1.8 million in total.\n\nMost of the group’s debt was incurred by Autobahn Rent A Car, which is understood to have a fleet of around 1,700 cars.\n\nA significant portion of Autobahn Rent A Car’s debt was for the hire-purchase of vehicles, including the S$70 million owed to Teck Wei Credit. It owes S$54.2 million to DBS for working capital, hire-purchase, property and trade financing.\n\nAutobahn’s other hire-purchase debts include S$22.8 million to auto group Motorway, S$9.8 million to Privilege Motors, S$8.6 million to OCBC, S$2.7 million to HL Bank, and S$2 million to Hong Leong Finance.\n\nThe company also owes UOB S$9.4 million.\n\nTwo major car dealerships are also creditors, both for car-purchase loans. Autobahn owes authorised Toyota dealer Borneo Motors S$7.2 million, and authorised Hyundai dealer Komoco Motors, S$2 million. Toyota Financial Services, an arm of Toyota Motor Corporation, is owed S$25 million by Shinsei Rent a Car.\n\nThe group owns multiple properties, including a building at 459 MacPherson Road, three units at 1 Kampong Ampat, and one unit each at 53 Ubi Avenue 1 and 25 Kaki Bukit Road 4.\n\nThe affidavit also stated that Tan Boon Kee, the majority shareholder and director of the original nine companies who is also known as Roy Tan, is prepared to sell his personal property – a semi-detached house at Carisbooke Grove – to support the scheme.\n\nIt added that the group is in “advanced discussions with a potential investor or ‘white knight’” who may participate in the restructuring. Rai did not name the investor, citing confidentiality obligations, but said he could file a sealed affidavit to give the court more information.\n\nDon Ho and David Ho of DHA+ Public Accounting Corporation have been appointed as the group’s joint and several scheme managers.\n\nDecoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

    "content": "Search\n\nKallang Wave Mall will be refreshed with new F&B and retail concepts\n\nShare\n\n[SINGAPORE] The Singapore Sports Hub will be renamed as The Kallang following a rebranding by its managing entity, Kallang Alive Sport Management (KASM) on Friday (Nov 28).\n\nThe rebranding applies to all of the Sports Hub’s current infrastructure and assets. KASM – a corporate entity set up by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and national sports agency Sport Singapore – is rebranding itself as The Kallang Group.\n\nPrior to the government’s takeover in 2022, the Sports Hub was managed by a private consortium.\n\n“We will refresh the mall with new F&B and retail concepts designed to elevate the visitor experience,” said The Kallang Group chairman Keith Magnus.\n\nHe added that the precinct’s developments will be aligned with broader developments such as the upcoming integrated national training centre to be used by Team Singapore, and a new 18,000-seat indoor arena.\n\n“When we took over in 2022, we made a deliberate pivot away from being just a venue-for-hire,” said Magnus. “We had to become the tip of the spear for curating world-class experiences, and a trusted partner to the world’s largest players in sport and entertainment.” He was speaking at an event held at the Bank of Singapore Lounge at the National Stadium. The Kallang Group’s chief executive officer Quek Swee Kuan was also in attendance.\n\nSince 2022, The Kallang has hosted over 4,000 sports, entertainment and community event days, with over 9.5 million visitors, added Magnus.\n\nIt is located on a 35-hectare site in Kallang and has various sports facilities and stadiums, in addition to 41,000 sq m of commercial space in the Kallang Wave Mall.\n\nThe rebranded Sports Hub’s 10 main facilities comprise the National Stadium, Singapore Indoor Stadium, OCBC Arena, OCBC Aquatic Centre, Water Sports Centre, Kallang Wave Mall, the Singapore Sports Museum, Shimano Cycling World, the Kallang Tennis Hub and the Kallang Football Hub.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nOCBC Bank signed a 15-year agreement with the Singapore Sports Hub in 2013 to be its premier founding partner.\n\nCapitaLand Investment also inked a six-year deal to manage the Kallang Wave Mall and the retail spaces in the Sports Hub from Apr 1, 2024 to Mar 31, 2030.\n\nThe rebranded Sports Hub is slated to host several major events in 2026, including the upgraded WTA 500 Singapore Tennis Open, the HSBC SVNS Singapore rugby event, and the National Day Parade.\n\nBesides sports, The Kallang has also hosted a range of international concerts. Hong Kong singer Jacky Cheung kicked off a six-show concert at the Indoor Stadium last week, while K-pop group Blackpink is staging three shows this week at the National Stadium.\n\n“This place has grown into a true community space – the National School Games, Pope’s Papal Mass, Majulah Fiesta, One Countdown – these events reiterate that this is a place for everyone,” said Magnus.\n\nDecoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

It was S$487 for vehicles with a maximum laden weight exceeding 3.5 tonnes.\n\nThese sums were the correct amounts payable, but they were higher than the rates wrongly published in the Road Traffic Act as S$298 and S$390, respectively.\n\nLTA discovered the discrepancy in March 2025 during a legislative review, and amended the subsidiary legislation to reflect the correct rates from Friday (Nov 28).\n\nIn response to queries, LTA said: “LTA and MOT (Ministry of Transport) required time to conduct a comprehensive impact assessment, and to work out the refund approach after seeking legal advice from AGC (the Attorney-General’s Chambers) on the appropriate course of action in accordance with the rule of law.”\n\nRefunds will be made via Giro to the affected vehicle owners who have registered their bank account details with LTA in their OneMotoring account; they will be made through PayNow for owners registered for it. No further action is required by affected owners.\n\nFor affected owners who have provided neither their bank account information to LTA nor registered for PayNow, LTA will notify them to update their bank account details via the OneMotoring website, or to register their PayNow account with their banks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n“LTA apologises for the error. We have put in place measures to strengthen our internal processes to avoid future occurrences,” the statutory board said.\n\nDecoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

    "content": "Search\n\nIt wants to strengthen its presence in Japan as financial markets gain momentum\n\nShare\n\n[TOKYO] Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC is moving to a larger office in Tokyo’s main financial district, strengthening its presence in Japan as the country’s financial markets gain momentum.\n\nThe company will leave its current place in Pacific Century Place Marunouchi, a building in which it owns a stake, and move into Shin-Marunouchi Building in early January, said people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified discussing private matters.\n\nA spokesperson for GIC confirmed that the firm is moving, adding that space will more than double.\n\nOwned by Mitsubishi Estate, the building is a 38-storey mixed-use office tower that is sandwiched between Tokyo Station and the Imperial Palace. The area, called Marunouchi, is one of the most prestigious office addresses in Tokyo, and commands some of the highest per-unit rents in the capital city.\n\nOther tenants in Shin-Marunouchi include Carlyle Group, SMBC Nikko Securities and Neuberger Berman Group. Mitsubishi Estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGIC has said in recent years it is more interested in opportunities in Japan as regulatory reform and the return of inflation has made the market attractive for deals and real estate investment.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nThe company said it sees significant bottom-up opportunities in the region, and it is sourcing for deals that “can generate good, risk-adjusted returns”, the company told Bloomberg in an e-mailed statement.\n\nStill, Japan exposure as a proportion of GIC’s overall portfolio had fallen to 4 per cent as at March 2024, compared with 12 per cent in 2019. GIC did not provide an updated figure for Japan investments in its annual report this year.\n\nLast year, GIC’s chief investment officer Bryan Yeo said in an interview that the firm plans to grow the team of 40 staff looking at deals related to Japan and expects the pipeline to get bigger.

    "content": "Search\n\nShare\n\n[SINGAPORE] Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh will learn on Dec 4 if his appeal against conviction on two charges of lying to the Committee of Privileges (COP) is successful.\n\nThe appeal hearing was held on Nov 4, with lawyers for the Leader of the Opposition arguing that the trial judge had “ignored crucial pieces of evidence” in convicting Singh of lying under oath to a parliamentary committee.\n\nSingh was convicted on Feb 17 and fined $14,000 for lying to the COP about the role that he had played in advising former MP Raeesah Khan to conceal an untruth to Parliament.\n\nDeputy Principal District Judge Luke Tan ruled that Singh had wilfully lied to the COP about how he dealt with the untruth, with evidence showing that Singh “never wanted Ms Khan to clarify (her) lie” and had “direct and intimate involvement” in nudging her to continue to lie.\n\nSingh’s appeal was heard in the High Court, with Justice Steven Chong presiding.\n\nAt the appeal hearing, defence lawyer Andre Jumabhoy called into question Khan’s credibility, arguing that she had provided different accounts of a meeting that took place on Aug 8, 2021.\n\nKhan said that at the meeting, she confessed to WP leaders – Singh, chairwoman Sylvia Lim and vice-chairman Faisal Manap – that she had lied about accompanying a sexual assault victim to a police station when she recounted the incident in a speech in Parliament on Aug 3, 2021.\n\nShe later repeated the false claim before the House on Oct 4 that year.\n\nKhan, who was then a Sengkang GRC MP, said that after the meeting at Singh’s home, she immediately texted her aides – Loh Pei Ying and Yudhishthra Nathan – and told them that the WP leaders had agreed she should take her lie to the grave.\n\nAt the appeal hearing, Jumabhoy cast doubts on the veracity of Khan’s account of the meeting at Singh’s home.\n\nHe said Khan had given three different accounts when recounting details of the meeting to the COP and later at Singh’s trial, including one instance when there was no suggestion that Singh had asked her to take the lie to the grave.\n\nJumabhoy said Singh was consistent with what was said during the Aug 8, 2021 meeting, which was that at some point Khan “would need to clarify the lie”.\n\nJustice Chong replied that Khan might not have used the phrase consistently in the three versions, but that does not mean it was not said.\n\nHe added that the defence cannot ignore the text message that Khan sent to her then aides, which stated that WP leaders had agreed the best course of action was to take the information to the grave.\n\nThe judge also asked the defence to explain why Singh appeared to be “doing nothing” to help Khan come clean between Aug 8, 2021, and their second meeting on Oct 3 that year.\n\nHe said that if Singh’s position was that Khan had to come clean at some point, steps would have been taken during this “critical” eight-week period.\n\nThe defence counsel said Singh did not act because he had more pressing matters to deal with at the time, including an important Bill the House was going to discuss on Oct 4, 2021.\n\nDeputy Attorney-General Goh Yihan argued that Singh’s inaction, and the multiple pieces of corroborative evidence including Khan’s message, as well as Loh’s and Nathan’s evidence, showed that the WP chief never intended for Khan to clarify her lie in Parliament.\n\n“This radio silence speaks volumes... the fact that he did not follow up must lead to the natural inference that there was nothing to follow up at all,” he said.

    "content": "Lawmakers from both U.S. parties said Sunday they support congressional reviews of military strikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.\n\nThe lawmakers said they did not know whether last week's Washington Post report — which Hegseth called \"fake news\" — was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.\n\n\"This rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no long able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.\n\n\"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\" Turner said.\n\nTurner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegation regarding the Sept. 2 attack \"is completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nThe comments from lawmakers during news show appearances come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. On Saturday, Trump said the airspace \"above and surrounding\" Venezuela should be considered as \"closed in its entirety,\" an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro . Maduro's government accused Trump of making a \"colonial threat\" and seeking to undermine the South American country's sovereignty.\n\nRepublican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chair of the Senate armed services committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee \"will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\"\n\nThat was followed Saturday with the chairman of the House armed services committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issuing a joint statement saying the panel was committed to \"providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defence's military operations in the Caribbean.\"\n\nDid Trump strike alleged Venezuelan drug boats with Canadian tech?\n\n\"We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,\" Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.\n\n\"We should get to the truth. I don't think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that's a clear violation of the law of war,\" Bacon said. \"So, I'm very suspicious that he would've done something like that because it would go against common sense.\"\n\nAfter the Post's report, Hegseth said Friday on X that \"fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.\"\n\nWhy Trump is at war with Venezuela | About That\n\n\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump on Sunday evening while flying back to Washington from Florida, where he celebrated Thanksgiving, said the administration \"will look into\" the matter but added, \"I wouldn't have wanted that — not a second strike.\" The president also defended Hegseth.\n\n\"Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,\" Trump said. He added, \"And I believe him.\"\n\nAlso on Sunday, Trump confirmed that he had recently spoken with Maduro.\n\nThe U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump also is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.\n\nTrump declined to comment on details of the call, which was first reported by the New York Times.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it went well or badly,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, when asked about the call.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the call with Trump.\n\nAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

    "content": "Some residents of the flood-hit Indonesian island of Sumatra have resorted to stealing food and water to survive, authorities said on Sunday, while Sri Lankan officials said deaths from floods and mudslides in that island nation have risen to 193.\n\nThe floods, which hit Indonesia nearly a week ago, have killed 442 people — with the number expected to rise as more bodies are recovered — and displaced 290,700 people. The deluges triggered landslides, damaged roads, cut off parts of the island and downed communication lines.\n\nAnother 402 people are missing in Indonesia’s three provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh, according to the National Disaster Management Agency.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions and the lack of heavy equipment also hampered rescue efforts. Aid has been slow to reach the hardest-hit city of Sibolga and Central Tapanuli district in North Sumatra.\n\nVideos on social media showed people scrambling past crumbling barricades, flooded roads and broken glass to get their hands on food, medicine and gas. Some waded through waist-deep floodwaters to reach damaged convenience stores.\n\nA police spokesperson, Ferry Walintukan, said they received reports of people breaking into shops on Saturday evening and that regional police had been deployed to restore order.\n\n\"The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,\" Walintukan said. \"[Residents] didn’t know that aid would come and were worried they would starve.\"\n\nEleven helicopters were deployed from Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, to the affected areas the day after the disaster for ongoing logistics distribution operations, especially to areas where land access was cut off, Cabinet Secretary Teddy Indra Wijaya said on Sunday, \"but unpredictable weather often hampers aid operations.\"\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat released footage of the military airdropping supplies to the affected areas. In the village of North Tapanuli, survivors waved frantically to the helicopters carrying aid. Meanwhile, four navy ships docked at a port to support aid distribution.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in Sri Lanka said the death toll from floods and mudslides has risen to 193, with 228 others still missing.\n\nNearly 148,000 people have been displaced from their homes and are housed in temporary shelters.\n\nSri Lanka has been battered by severe weather since last week. Conditions worsened on Thursday, with heavy downpours that flooded homes, fields and roads and triggered landslides, mainly in the tea-growing central hill country.\n\nAuthorities say Cyclone Ditwah, which developed in the seas east of Sri Lanka, is likely to move toward India’s southern coast on Sunday.\n\nAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

    "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/livestory/ukraine-war-peace-talks-florida-9.6997954?cmp=rss",
    "content": "What is Ukraine seeking in latest peace talks?\n\nU.S. optimism around Ukraine peace talks met with skepticism\n\nKey issues remain as U.S. deadline for Ukraine peace deal nears\n\nTrump envoy Witkoff to discuss Ukraine plan in Moscow next week\n\nTrump says Ukraine peace deal is getting close\n\nAlthough officials provided few details about negotiations, both U.S. and Ukrainian officials emerged from their meeting largely with the same optimism they entered with.\n\nIf you're here for a recap of the day, you can sort updates from oldest to newest by clicking \"Latest first\" underneath the video carousel.\n\nAs always, you can continue to follow our coverage on CBCNews.ca.\n\nThe U.S. special envoy will head to Russia next for yet another round of talks about the peace plan as the war rages on.\n\nTrump has said he'll send Steve Witkoff, and possibly Kushner, to Moscow this week to meet with Putin. A Kremlin spokesperson, quoted Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin leaves for India.\n\nNegotiators continue to say they're making progress and that the framework for the deal has changed, but little is known about the specifics of what's been discussed — or how close the sides are to reaching a deal.\n\nRubio and Umerov just emerged from the meeting to make very brief comments to reporters.\n\nRubio said talks were useful and productive, but \"much work remains\" to be done. He said the two sides are not just talking about ending the war, but also about securing Ukraine's future.\n\n\"This is delicate. It's complicated,\" he said.\n\nUmerov expressed gratitude to U.S. leadership and said the meeting was \"productive and successful.\"\n\nNeither offered further details or took questions from reporters.\n\nHello, I'm Kevin Maimann, a senior writer on the national desk. Negotiations have not reached a consensus on what security guarantees for Ukraine would look like.\n\nAs the CBC's Briar Stewart reported, Ukraine wants binding guarantees from its allies , not just words of assurance.\n\nUkraine’s bid to join NATO is uncertain, but one proposal floated by Italy – and inspired by NATO’s Article 5 – would obligate allies to assist Ukraine when it’s attacked. Witkoff told CNN that Putin had offered a concession on an \"Article 5-like\" guarantee during the August U.S.-Russia summit meeting, though Russia has not confirmed that.\n\nCanada and other allies have said they could send peacekeeping troops into Ukraine if there's a ceasefire, but Russia has been adamant it would not allow NATO troops in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. could provide surveillance equipment, but Trump has said he won't send American soldiers.\n\nThe 28-point peace plan does say if Moscow were to invade Ukraine again, all global sanctions will be re-imposed on Russia and all other benefits of the deal revoked, in addition to a co-ordinated military response — which could be a strong incentive for Russia to keep the peace.\n\nLithuania's Vilnius Airport says it has temporarily halted operations due to suspected balloons in its airspace, according to Reuters.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a series of flight disruptions in the Baltic nation. The airport has been closed at least 10 times since early October.\n\nSeveral European countries have experienced airspace interference in recent months, with airports in Copenhagen and Brussels flagging drone sightings and incursions.\n\nLithuania says it believes weather balloons flown by smugglers are transporting contraband cigarettes, and has blamed Alexander Lukashenko, the president of neighbouring Belarus for allowing the practice, calling it a form of \"hybrid attack.\"\n\nI’m a producer with CBCNews.ca based in Toronto, and I'll be curating your updates this afternoon.\n\nUkraine's first deputy foreign minister says talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials on ending Russia's war with Ukraine are off to a \"good start,\" according to Reuters.\n\nSergiy Kyslytsya also praised Rubio's \"great leadership,\" saying talks were happening in a \"warm atmosphere, conducive to potential progressive outcome.\"\n\nDiplomats have been in ramped-up peace talks since Trump unveiled a 28-point plan that European allies say looked more like a \"wish list\" for Russia.\n\nThe plan initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia, which Kyiv does not want to give up.\n\nIt would also impose limits on the size of Ukraine's military, block the country from joining NATO and require Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days.\n\nUkrainian negotiators say the plan has since changed , with fewer points, though it's not clear which provisions have been altered.\n\nAs my colleague Briar Stewart wrote last week, it appears there isn't yet a consensus on control over the disputed regions in Eastern Ukraine, nor on the issue of security guarantees.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and possibly Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan.\n\nBoth Witkoff and Kushner, like Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy, writes The Associated Press. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza — though hundreds of deaths have been reported since it went into effect on Oct. 10.\n\n\n\nStakes ‘quite high’ ahead of Ukraine-U.S. meeting to discuss end to war with Russia: expert\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with U.S. officials for the latest round of negotiations over plans to end the war with Russia. Andrew Rasiulis, a fellow with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, says this meeting is ‘one of the last opportunities’ for a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nToday's meeting may be one of Ukraine's last opportunities for a negotiated settlement to the end of the war, said Andrew Rasiulis, a fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute and a retired Department of National Defence official.\n\nThe stakes are \"quite high,\" Rasiulis said in an interview on CBC News Network this morning.\n\nTime is running out before the war concludes through military force, he explained, noting Russia has the advantage on the battlefield so Ukraine is negotiating from the weaker position.\n\n\"All these proposals that we're seeing, they do in some way favour the Russians. That is a reflection of the battlefield reality,\" Rasiulis said.\n\nThe biggest sticking point, he says, will be the remainder of the Donbas, especially the fortified area around Donetsk. A possible compromise could be a demilitarized zone rather than outright legal concession of territory, Rasiulis said.\n\nHe said Witkoff may actually be better positioned than anyone else to broker a deal because he is the only figure speaking to both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"The Americans are now virtually neutral in this. They're listening to the Russians, they're listening to the Ukrainians,\" Rasiulis said.\n\nWhat is Ukraine seeking in latest peace talks?\n\nUkrainian negotiators are meeting with U.S. officials in Florida to discuss details of Washington’s proposed framework to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, as Kyiv faces pressure on military and political fronts. Ukrainian MP Halyna Yanchenko tells Rosemary Barton Live what she hopes will be different about these talks compared to previous negotiations.\n\nHello, I'm a writer with CBC Politics in Ottawa. My colleague Rosemary Barton just finished an interview on her show with Halyna Yanchenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament.\n\nYanchenko said it's very important for Ukraine to get security guarantees since Russia will invade Ukraine again if it gets the chance.\n\nEvery time Russia returns, \"they come up with more tanks, more soldiers and more atrocities among civilians,\" she said.\n\nYanchenko also said the peace deal's proposal to give Ukrainian territory to Russia is an \"unacceptable\" demand, since people live in those areas and sacrificing the land means they'll be living under occupation.\n\nThe Associated Press is reporting some of the comments made at the start of the meeting between the two delegations.\n\n\"The end goal, obviously, is not just the end of the war,\" Rubio said. \"It's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"\n\nThe teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in Hallandale Beach, Fla., north of Miami.\n\nUmerov replied that he wanted to express his country's appreciation for U.S. efforts.\n\n\"U.S. is hearing us,\" Umerov said. \"U.S. is supporting us. U.S. is working beside us.\"\n\nAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

    "title": "Trump sent federal troops to 'save' Chicago. The 'Midway Blitz' raids forced the Windy City to defend itself | CBC News",
    "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chicago-sanctuary-city-war-zone-9.6996046?cmp=rss",
    "content": "In the middle of the night on Sept. 30, Eboni Watson heard an unusual buzzing sound.\n\nThe noise came from 10 drones and three Black Hawk helicopters, Watson says, which dropped armed men on neighbouring rooftops in Chicago's South Shore neighbourhood. On the ground, Watson saw agents deploy out of unmarked cars and rental vans.\n\n“It was bringing people outside because it was such a disturbance. You have people that was thinking UFOs and stuff was landing,” Watson, who livestreamed the situation , told CBC News.\n\nBut it wasn't an alien invasion. It was a federal immigration raid involving hundreds of agents.\n\nEleanor McMullen-Webster was among those arrested.\n\n“When I opened that door, I tell you, I saw that little red light, and that gun was right in my face,” McMullen-Webster told CBC.\n\nFederal agents handcuffed the 64-year-old retiree and her husband, she says, directing them into an apartment where Venezuelan migrants were lined up against a wall.\n\nThe raid on the South Shore apartment complex was part of a larger initiative by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to capture the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois, according to a press release . Codenamed Operation Midway Blitz, the mission was to capture undocumented migrants allowed to “roam free on American streets” due to the state’s sanctuary policies.\n\nThat night, authorities arrested 37 immigrants, mostly Venezuelans, though none have been charged.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says two of them are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan transnational criminal group the U.S. designated a terrorist organization in February, but didn't release names. One of those men denied any association with the organization in an interview with ProPublica .\n\n‘Don't shoot me. I am not a Venezuelan’: South Shore resident details Midway Blitz arrest\n\nAfter being held for more than an hour, McMullen-Webster and her husband were released, without an explanation.\n\n“I felt this small,” said the Chicago resident, still furious at the “disrespectful” way she was treated.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has faced sharp criticism, including from former president Barack Obama and Pope Leo , who is from Chicago. Both admonished the vilification of migrants.\n\nBut the idea of “saving” Chicago has been ongoing for years.\n\nWhile running for president in 2016, Trump frequently invoked the city’s violent crime rate, calling Chicago a “war zone” and saying minorities in “inner cities” were “living in hell.”\n\nTwo weeks before his assassination , MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk — a Chicago native — spoke out in favour of Trump's efforts to apprehend \"illegal criminals” trying to “take over” the U.S. “from within.” At Kirk’s memorial , Trump said one of the last things Kirk said to him was, “Please, sir, save Chicago.”\n\n“We're going to do that,” Trump told the crowd. “We're going to save Chicago from horrible crime.”\n\nBut in the wake of Operation Midway Blitz, Chicagoans themselves are divided over who the criminals are — and who is ultimately responsible for keeping their city safe.\n\nThe helicopter-assisted ICE raids took place three weeks after Trump threatened the city in a post on Truth Social . It included an image of him as a military commander with the caption, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” a reference to the 1979 war film Apocalypse Now .\n\nTrump’s rocky relationship with Chicago goes back years. In 2014, he built a 20-foot-tall steel sign spelling out his name on the city’s Trump Tower. The move drew widespread backlash , including from then-mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nAs president , Trump blasted the city’s tolerance of illegal immigration, saying violence in Chicago was “worse than some of the places … where you have wars going on.” He frequently took aim at local officials on social media, threatening to “send in the Feds” in January 2017.\n\n‘Bring it on,’ Chicago woman says in response to Trump’s threats to use city as military ‘training ground’\n\nCrime in “sanctuary” cities has been a focal point for the second Trump administration. After deploying the National Guard in August to address the “complete and total lawlessness” in Washington, D.C., he again vowed to send federal troops to “straighten out” Chicago.\n\nRobert Reich, a former U.S. secretary of labour, suggested it's all a concerted effort to suppress the vote in the 2026 mid-term elections.\n\n“He is saying to himself and maybe others quietly, this is a way to intimidate [residents],” Reich said. “‘If they're just afraid to be very public in any way, then I win, because they're not going to vote.’”\n\nThe force used by federal agents in the South Shore apartment complex is far from isolated.\n\nIn Evanston, Ill., a car was following a vehicle of DHS officers when agents slammed on the brakes, resulting in a crash. While arresting the activists, one of whom was severely beaten by officers, an immigration agent threatened to shoot a civilian filming the arrests.\n\n“I believe that they're acting with total authority, but without any sort of oversight at all, and they should be held accountable for their actions,” said local resident David Brooks, who had a pistol pointed at him.\n\nThis man filmed an arrest by border patrol agents. One threatened him with a gun\n\nMichael Rodriguez, a representative for Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, characterized the immigration raids as an “absolute betrayal” of the U.S. Constitution and the American people.\n\n“This is a disgrace to our country, to our legacy,\" he said. \"It will live in infamy.”\n\nDemocratic Chicago committeeman Raymond Lopez says the violent nature of the raids have made his constituents — many of whom are long-term undocumented, mostly Mexican immigrants — fearful of going outside.\n\nDespite growing opposition , some Chicago residents have welcomed Trump’s aggressive actions as a way to keep the city safe.\n\n“When you place unvetted gang members into our buildings amongst us with our kids, then you put us in danger. And that's what we have seen in our communities,” said Danielle Carter-Walters, vice-president of grassroots conservative movement Chicago Flips Red.\n\nThe current violent crime rate in Chicago is down about 40 per cent from 2023, which had the most reported incidents in the last decade, city data shows . Crime across Illinois has followed a similar downward trend , though rates of homicide and rape remain higher than the national average.\n\nTexas governor charters plane to send migrants to Chicago\n\nRamona Paravola, operations manager of Chicago Flips Red, says poor, often Black neighbourhoods were forced to absorb newcomers under the Biden administration — including more than 30,000 from Texas .\n\n“They are not spreading the load out,” said Paravola, who believes politicians knew that adding migrant shelters to an “affluent white neighbourhood” would face greater backlash.\n\nSeeing migrants receive help that Black Chicagoans have been demanding for years is another source of resentment. In 2024, for example, city officials invested more than $300 million US to address the migrant crisis — money, they say, should have been invested into their communities first.\n\nCity of Chicago hasn’t kept its citizens safe from crime, says conservative group\n\n“How does that happen when they told us that they didn't have these [funds]?” said Carter-Walters.\n\n“It's not Black and brown people. It's Black Americans versus brown illegals,” said Paravola.\n\nParavola, whose husband is a retired Chicago police officer, says she supports pathways to citizenship for “Dreamers” who come to America, including undocumented migrants without violent criminal records.\n\n“We're not racist,” she said. “We're just intelligent enough to see people as individuals, or as individual communities, and not Black and brown as a big lump.”\n\nPresbyterian minister Rev. David Black has witnessed the violent methods used against immigrants employed against protesters at the ICE detention facility in nearby Broadview, Ill.\n\nBlack was praying for ICE agents and calling on them to “repent” on Sept. 19 when officers on the roof of the facility shot him in the face, head and body with pepper balls.\n\nImmediately after, video shows Black shouting, “God is watching you — and you will pay for this!”\n\n“It seems like they've been testing out how much they can get away with … as they suppress free speech and try to dismantle the civil society of a major American city,” Black told CBC News.\n\nThis pastor was shot by immigration agents while calling for them to ‘repent’\n\nWhen Kat Abughazaleh, a congressional candidate, first visited the Broadview facility for a vigil in the summer, she said ICE “didn’t even board up the windows.\" Since then, she has witnessed the “one-sided violence” by ICE agents escalate.\n\n“People were dragged, beaten,” she said.\n\nAbughazaleh, a journalist, was thrown to the ground herself at multiple rallies. In one video that went viral, Abughazaleh can be heard hitting the asphalt after being shoved by immigration officers.\n\n“They shot pepper bullets at the sidewalk and said, ‘Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk,’” she said.\n\nSeveral protesters ‘abducted’ by immigration agents in tactical gear, says congressional candidate\n\nMeanwhile, Sister JoAnn Persch, who worked with migrants in the Chicago area for 40 years, was repeatedly denied access to provide spiritual care to detainees at the Broadview facility. Authorities cited “safety reasons.”\n\n“All these years I've been right with immigrants, I've never felt they were going to attack me and surely I was not going to attack them,” said the 91-year-old nun, who was not allowed inside to visit migrants during a Nov. 1 mass.\n\nEarlier this month, the spiritual coalition Persch was a part of sued the federal government for what they allege are violations of First Amendment rights to religious freedom.\n\nPersch, a Sister of Mercy who got a state law passed in 2009 to allow pastoral workers into immigration facilities, said the situation made her “extremely sad.”\n\n“There's just so many human rights being violated in that building. So we just have to keep working for human and religious rights,” said Persch, who died on Nov. 14.\n\nTwo months since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz, federal authorities and Chicago locals still find themselves at odds on whether the mission to “save” Chicago has succeeded.\n\nAt the end of October, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem boasted that agents “ arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens including rapists, murderers and gang members” since September.\n\nBut a Chicago Tribune analysis of government records found that of 614 arrestees whose names were released by the Department of Justice, only 16 — or 2.6 per cent — had criminal histories.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has defended the agency’s tactics, asserting in an interview that their “operations are airtight — legal, ethical and moral.”\n\nWhy is Trump at war with Chicago?\n\nBut the widespread use of force has led to judicial scrutiny of the government’s tactics in Chicago. Bovino was subpoenaed to appear in federal court about his agents’ use of force against protesters in the Chicago area, and in a 233-page ruling released Nov. 20, Judge Sara L. Ellis identified “inconsistencies” in his testimony.\n\nEllis said Bovino “appeared evasive” throughout his deposition, either providing “cute” responses to the plaintiffs’ questions or “outright lying.”\n\nThe judge wrote that videos contradicted Bovino’s claims that his agents’ use of force was justified.\n\nEllis’s ruling prevents federal agents from using tear gas against people who do not pose a threat. A federal appeals court paused the injunction on Nov. 19, calling it “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.”\n\nDHS did not respond to multiple requests from CBC News to interview Bovino.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol agents ultimately left Chicago in mid-November. Committeeman Rodriguez believes resistance efforts in the city were a large factor.\n\n“It wasn't just the weather. I think [federal agents] knew they encountered people that weren't gonna take their BS,” he said. “We know what makes us safe. We keep us safe. Not Donald Trump.”\n\nBut Abughazaleh believes this fight won't be “over” for years.\n\n“We're living in a horror movie,” she said. “A lot of our most important systems are being razed to the ground. But that does mean that we have an opportunity to build something better.”\n\nWith files from Alex Shprintsen and Terence McKenna\n\nAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

    "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/netanyahu-pardon-request-corruption-trial-9.6997900?cmp=rss",
    "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday asked the country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges — seeking to end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.\n\nNetanyahu, who has been at war against the country’s legal system over the charges, said the request would help unify the country at a time of momentous changes in the region. But it immediately triggered denunciations from his opponents, who said it would weaken Israel’s democratic institutions and send a dangerous message that he is above the rule of law.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the prime minister’s office said that Netanyahu had submitted a request for a pardon to the legal department of the Office of the President. The president’s office called it an \"extraordinary request,\" carrying with it \"significant implications.\"\n\nNetanyahu is the only sitting prime minister in Israeli history to stand trial, after being charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases accusing him of exchanging favours with wealthy political supporters. He has not been convicted on any of the charges.\n\nNetanyahu rejects the allegations and has condemned the case as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media, police and judiciary.\n\nThe request comes weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu . Earlier this month Trump also sent a letter to President Isaac Herzog calling the corruption case \"political, unjustified prosecution.\"\n\nIn a videotaped statement, Netanyahu said the trial has divided the country and that a pardon would help restore national unity. He also said the requirement that he appear in court three times a week is a distraction that makes it difficult for him to lead the country.\n\n\"The continuation of the trial tears us apart from within, stirs up this division, and deepens rifts. I am sure, like many others in the nation, that an immediate conclusion of the trial would greatly help to lower the flames and promote the broad reconciliation that our country so desperately needs,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu has taken the stand multiple times over the past year, but the case has been repeatedly delayed as he has dealt with wars and unrest stemming from the Hamas-led attacks of October 2023, and Israel's military action in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu trial opens amid demonstrations\n\nNetanyahu’s pardon request consisted of two documents — a detailed letter signed by his lawyer and a letter signed by himself.\n\nThey’ll be sent to the Ministry of Justice for opinions and will then be transferred to the legal adviser in the president's office, which will formulate additional opinions for the president.\n\nLegal experts say the pardon request is not able to stop the trial.\n\n\"It’s impossible,\" said Emi Palmor, former director general of the Justice Ministry.\n\n\"You cannot claim that you’re innocent while the trial is going on and come to the president and ask him to intervene,\" she said, adding that the only way to stop the trial is to ask the attorney general to withhold the proceedings.\n\nNetanyahu’s request sparked an immediate response from the opposition and advocacy groups, which urged the president not to give in to his request.\n\n\"You cannot grant him a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and an immediate retirement from political life,\" opposition leader Yair Lapid said.\n\nThe Movement for Quality Government in Israel said granting a pardon to a prime minister accused of serious offences of fraud and breach of trust would send a clear message that there are citizens who are above the law.\n\nAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

    "title": "A 'more serious public image': How the Princess of Wales is making it clear she's back in the public eye | CBC News",
    "link": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/catherine-princess-of-wales-role-queen-camilla-anne-of-green-gables-9.6996832?cmp=rss",
    "content": "After finishing her chemotherapy treatment last year, it was clear that Catherine, Princess of Wales, would take only measured and gradual steps back into public life.\n\nOne notable step came the other day when she made her first public speech in two years. She spok e of her work promoting e arly childhood development and urged the 80 business leaders in attendance to see virtue in supporting caregivers and helping employees have healthy family lives at home.\n\n“As business leaders, you will face the daily challenge of finding the balance between profitability and having a positive impact. But the two are not and should not be incompatible,” Catherine told the Future Workforce Summit.\n\nA few days later, Catherine called for an end to the “stigma” that surrounds addiction.\n\n“By talking about it in the open, together we can bring addiction and the harm it causes out of the shadows,” she said in a message to mark Addiction Awareness Week in the U.K.\n\n“We can reframe this issue with kindness and understanding, and we can help individuals and families coping with addiction know they are not alone.”\n\nIn both instances — talking with business leaders and sending out the Addiction Awareness Week message — there were signals of the priorities Catherine has for her public work and how she is gradually and deliberately defining her role as Princess of Wales.\n\nIt’s not necessarily easy.\n\n“It's a tremendously daunting task because of the legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales, because of the popular associations in mainstream culture, the pedestal that Diana was placed upon as the ideal princess,” said Justin Vovk, a royal historian and member of the advisory board of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada.\n\nDiana, the late mother of Catherine’s husband, Prince William, became a high-wattage celebrity royal , one with personal struggles and an open way who seemed to make an emotional connection with people, even those who watched with interest from afar.\n\nEven in the 21st century, Vovk suggested, gendered views about royalty continue that, particularly for women, are unfair in terms of the expectations placed upon them in popular culture.\n\nThere is, he said, the expectation that a princess has to be beautiful, perfectly dressed and say the right thing at the right time.\n\n“Everything has to be perfect, and if one thing is off, then it's a social media scandal.”\n\nCatherine “has very big shoes to fill, and I think she's still looking to define her role as Princess of Wales,” Vovk said, noting there was a relatively short period between her becoming Princess of Wales in September 2022 and stepping back after her cancer diagnosis in early 2024.\n\nWith the speech to the business leaders, Catherine focused on issues that have been a priority for her.\n\n“Catherine's continuing to build on her interest in advocacy for early childhood education and development,” Toronto-based royal author and historian Carolyn Harris said in an interview.\n\nAs Catherine has been building on that interest, and others such as mental health, the public focus on her has evolved.\n\n“In some of her early public appearances in the first years of her marriage to Prince William, there was a lot of focus on her fashions and William and Catherine being a breath of fresh air for the Royal Family,” Harris said.\n\nNow, she said, “we're seeing Catherine adopting a more serious public image, focusing very closely on the issues that she cares most about and also making very clear that she is back in the public eye.”\n\nPrincess Kate declares she’s cancer-free in polished, positive video\n\nCatherine stepped away for several months after her cancer diagnosis and, Harris said, “there were real concerns about whether she would be taking up full-time public duties once more.\"\n\nAs much as Catherine can draw public attention to causes, there are limitations around what she might say or do.\n\n“The Royal Family can't get too close to actual policy and politics,” Craig Prescott, a constitutional expert and lecturer in law at Royal Holloway, University of London, said in an interview.\n\n“They can raise an issue, but they can't ... say everyone should have a year's parental leave or something, because that's a matter for politics.”\n\nCatherine founded the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood in 2021, and Prescott said it “has been really interesting” in the sense that it has brought a focus to a specific issue, commissioned research and made broad proposals.\n\n“But the difficulty is what happens to them after that,” Prescott said. “And that's really for others to do as much as anything and for people in government to take notice, for other groups to take notice.\"\n\nIn the speech to business leaders, Catherine also focused on the theme of love.\n\n“My passion and the work of the Centre for Early Childhood stems from one essential truth: that the love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults.\"\n\nLove is also a theme for this year’s edition of the Christmas carol service Catherine hosts at Westminster Abbey on Friday.\n\nVovk expects we will see more of her in the months ahead. And he expects there will be echoes of themes that were front and centre in her recent speech and recognition of Addiction Awareness Week.\n\n“I think that the branding and the messaging is going to stay the same,” he said.\n\n“William and Catherine are both very much, like [King] Charles, about consistency, duty, clear messaging.”\n\nWhen Queen Camilla welcomed winners of the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition to St. James’s Palace the other day, Canada — and a certain Canadian literary icon — were top of mind.\n\n“This year, many of the essays came from Canada, a country that is dear to both my husband and to myself, and which we were lucky enough to visit briefly in May,” Camilla told her audience.\n\nOver the past 10 years, there have been four winners and runners-up of the competition from Canada. Camilla suggested perhaps some of them had been inspired by “one of the world’s greatest children’s authors, L.M. Montgomery.\"\n\nCamilla, who has a long-standing interest in promoting reading and literacy, also suggested this year’s winners had something in common with Lucy Maud Montgomery’s well-known redhead, Anne of Green Gables.\n\n“Anne, like all of you here, is a passionate book lover and a gifted storyteller. As L.M. Montgomery said, ‘You have the itch for writing born in you. It’s quite incurable. What are you going to do with it?’”\n\nIn the speech, Harris saw connections between Camilla’s interests in reading and the potential interests of Catherine, Princess of Wales, dating back to the first visit she and Prince William made to Canada shortly after they were married in 2011.\n\nThat visit included considerable time in Prince Edward Island, where Montgomery set Anne of Green Gables .\n\n“There was widespread speculation that this extended time in Prince Edward Island reflected Catherine's interest, that she was a fan of Anne of Green Gables ,” Harris said.\n\n“Queen Camilla and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, they both seem to be prolific readers, and there's clearly some overlap in terms of their tastes in both children's literature and adult literature.\"\n\nCamilla has also crossed paths with a latter-day Anne, meeting an actor playing the character while on a visit with Charles, then the Prince of Wales, to Charlottetown in 2014.\n\nIn her recent speech, Camilla noted some royal connections for Montgomery in Canada.\n\nThose references, Harris said, conflated three events in the late 1920s and the 1930s, including Montgomery’s receipt of an award in 1935 from the governor general of the day, Lord Bessborough, as part of King George V birthday honours.\n\n“Lucy Maud Montgomery throughout her life was quite interested in the Royal Family, and she proved to be quite an astute royal watcher,” Harris said, noting, for example, her journal account of a 1927 garden party in Toronto honouring the Prince of Wales of the day (the future King Edward VIII) and Prince George.\n\n“As she noted, the future King Edward VIII seemed bored and blasé, and she didn't blame him, he had to meet 4,000 people, but she thought that he didn't seem to be particularly enjoying himself and that would be very prescient going into the abdication crisis of 1936.\"\n\nIn her diary, Montgomery also recounts watching a military parade in Toronto during the 1939 visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.\n\n“She refers in her diary to George VI and Queen Elizabeth as our King and Queen and talks about how exciting this royal visit was. And it's one of the last happy entries in her journal that ... continues in subsequent entries to talk about her husband's mental health struggles,” Harris said.\n\nThere are also a lot of royal mentions in Montgomery’s works, Harris said.\n\n“There's a reference in Anne of Green Gables where Anne says that she and Diana have discovered this new little island in the creek, and they'll name it Victoria Island, because they found it on Queen Victoria's birthday.\"\n\nWhile Montgomery was interested in the Royal Family, that didn't mean she idealized them, Harris said.\n\n“She noted that these were human beings who had complicated legacies and personalities.\"\n\nCamilla ended her recent speech with a quote attributed to Anne, saying that she would heed it: “The point of good writing is knowing when to stop.\"\n\nThe quote, Harris noted, is actually spoken by another character, who seemed to be critical of female writers, in the fifth Anne of Green Gables novel, Anne's House of Dreams.\n\n“Another quote from the Anne of Green Gables series of novels spoken by Anne herself — or her inspirational teacher Miss Stacy — might have been a better choice for the speech.\"\n\nHarris said it’s interesting to see Anne of Green Gables being highlighted now, given the timeless nature of some of its themes, such as friendship and family.\n\n“Clearly Queen Camilla sees the potential for Anne of Green Gables to speak to a whole new generation.”\n\nTwo members of the Royal Family who have been doing a lot of international travelling were back home in recent days after trips to South and Central America and Africa.\n\nPrince Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh, wrapped up a visit to Nigeria and Ghana that focused on supporting young people and highlighting the positive impact of sport.\n\nSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, visited Peru, Panama and Guatemala at the request of the U.K. Foreign Office and continued her travels in Belize as part of the Royal Family’s engagement with Commonwealth realms.\n\nEdward’s time in Nigeria included a forum for the Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award in Lagos. Nearly 200 youth from 50 countries, including Canada, were at the event, which has been held previously in Toronto.\n\n“The U.K. is always trying to further and establish its place in the world, so to speak, that using the Royal Family in countries where we don't necessarily have the strongest links, such as Guatemala and Peru, is perhaps no bad thing,\" Prescott said.\n\n“I don't know how these things were reported there, but just the presence of a member of the Royal Family might be particularly newsworthy, and that does the U.K. no harm at all in the very broadest of international contexts.”\n\nVovk said that while there’s nothing unusual about senior members of the Royal Family being deployed around the world, he thought it was “quite telling” that the Commonwealth was being emphasized in the recent trips by Edward and Sophie.\n\n\"There's a very clear push from the monarchy right now to be shoring up those connections, renewing those connections, strengthening them with Commonwealth realms, because for the last six months to a year, maybe longer ... the Crown has been very detained by issues at home.”\n\n“If we all want to continue to enjoy and benefit from the wonders of the natural world, we must not be the generation that stands by as wildlife and biodiversity disappears.”\n\n— Prince William, in a speech at the 2025 Tusk Conservation Awards.\n\nSweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia were welcomed to Rideau Hall by a small crowd of onlookers waving Swedish flags after they arrived in Ottawa for a three-day visit to Canada.

    "content": "Winter Olympians who have signed up to stay in Cortina d'Ampezzo's Athletes Village should not expect luxury accommodations or a cozy fire to snuggle up next to after a long day on the mountain.\n\nThe temporary Village that will house up to 1,400 athletes and other team members during the Feb. 6-22 Milan Cortina Games consists of 377 rented mobile homes arranged close to one another on a humid valley floor.\n\nThe Associated Press was the first international media outlet allowed in for an early look at the facility, which is in an unpopulated area about a 10-minute drive or one-hour walk north of downtown Cortina.\n\nThe rooms are simple and spartan.\n\nIn exchange for amenities, though, comes close contact to the Dolomites.\n\n\"It's located in a very quiet area of Cortina, where you have the opportunity to hear the sound of the mountains, isolate yourself if you wish, concentrate if you desire, or go out for a pleasant workout,\" said Fabio Saldini, the Italian government commissioner overseeing infrastructure for the Games.\n\n\"The beauty of a Village like this lies in the fact that everything will be removed afterward. Nothing is permanent; the environment will not return to its previous state but will be improved,\" Saldini added. \"This is a temporary village, but of high design.\"\n\nProviding lodging for athletes is one of the most important responsibilities for Olympic organizers. It's particularly challenging for the geographically dispersed Milan Cortina Games. Cortina's trailer park is one of the two main Olympic villages, the other in Milan.\n\nWinter sports powerhouse Norway has chosen to house its skiers in hotels rather than in the official Olympic villages, according to Norwegian news agency NTB.\n\nMany other nations like the U.S. and Germany, plus host Italy, said their athletes will stay in the villages, though it's unlikely alpine superstars Lindsey Vonn or Mikaela Shiffrin will stay in the mobile home park in Cortina.\n\nCortina will host women's alpine skiing, curling, bobsled, luge and skeleton during the Games. The Village will also be essential for the Paralympics, which will be held March 6-15.\n\n\"Most of the nations will use the Village, both for the living part and above all for the common areas like the gym,\" Saldini said. \"Even those staying outside the Village will come here.\"\n\nEach trailer is divided into two rooms, with up to two people in each room. Every room has its own bathroom and shower. But open the trailer door and athletes could be met with a biting wind each morning or might be treated to unforgettable images of the sun lighting up and reflecting off jagged mountain peaks.\n\nWarm boots, not slippers, might be the best attire for the walk to the big cafeteria for breakfast. Anyone staying in trailers near the outskirts of the 1.4-kilometre long Village will have a 10-minute walk to the common areas, which also include a gym, game room, offices, relaxation areas and laundromat.\n\nA snowstorm made for blizzard-like conditions during AP's visit in late November, without any permanent buildings to block the wind.\n\nFebruary, though, brings more hours of sunlight to the area.\n\nThe altitude at the Village area is 1,292 metres (4,239 feet) - slightly higher than in downtown Cortina.\n\n\"There's just the forest here,\" said Paride Casagrande, the Village's construction manager. \"The wind is an element. But it doesn't blow all day long every day. It depends on the day. There could be very cold days and there could be very comfortable days. But the fact remains that we're in a natural area where it's cold.\"\n\nEvery new event at Milano Cortina 2026\n\nWhen organizers of the Paris Summer Olympics announced they would not provide air conditioners in the Athletes Village, the U.S. and other teams brought their own machines, undercutting plans to cut carbon emissions.\n\nNobody should have to bring their own climate-controlling machines this time.\n\nEvery room in the Cortina Village has its own heating controls.\n\nA thermostat regulates a heating unit mounted on the wall and there's also an infrared panel on the ceiling that helps maintain the temperature, both run on electricity.\n\n\"Without much power, the temperature can be brought up to 25-26 degrees Celsius, which should be all that's necessary,\" Casagrande said.\n\n\"But it's all subjective, considering that I've been seeing athletes walking around outside in their underwear even though it's snowing out,\" Casagrande added, referring to sliding competitors in town for a test event. \"The choice is up to the athletes.\"\n\nIn 100 days the Milan-Cortina Olympics will open. Where will you be?\n\nEvery mobile home sits on at least two wheels, used only for positioning, not transport, Casagrande said.\n\nThe homes were brought to Cortina by oversize-load trucks.\n\nAll the rooms are about 18 square metres (200 square feet), with one of the two rooms in each mobile home slightly larger than the other to accommodate Paralympians.\n\nThe rooms for Paralympians also have handicap-accessible showers, toilets and beds.\n\nThe total cost for the Village is 38 million euros ($44 million US).\n\nWhile the mobile homes are being rented, it would cost up to 80,000 euros ($93,000) to buy one.\n\nAfter the Olympics and the Paralympics, the mobile homes will be re-used at camping sites around Italy, with some of them already destined for a hockey club in nearby Brunico.\n\nThe bigger buildings, also temporary, for the cafeteria, gym and other common areas are already being heated by a thermal power plant running on natural gas that also warms the Village's water supply. Air handling units placed on top of the buildings regulate the air.\n\nTrees were cut down to set the Village up, drawing some protests from climate activists.\n\n\"Most of them were already dead,\" Casagrande said. \"But we've also brought in new plants and [trees]. This is a natural park and we're going to leave it just as we found it.\"\n\nAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.\n\nGet up to speed on what's happening in sports.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Becky Bohrer\n\nVANCOUVER - A foundation trying to save a critically endangered species is celebrating a marmot milestone.\n\nThe Marmot Recovery Foundation announced on its social media page that the population of the Vancouver Island species has reached a new high of 427 marmots.\n\nWhen its team first began releasing marmots to the wild in 2003, there were just 22 remaining, and its statement says there was a lot of doubt that the species could be saved.\n\nIt says when the group released the first four of the beaver-like animals into the wild 22 years ago, three of them were eaten by cougars within weeks.\n\nThe foundation says the following year was better with seven marmots released, and two of them were the first to breed in the wild and survived for more than a decade.\n\nThe Vancouver Island marmot is considered one of Canada’s most endangered species, and the rodent has five distinct whistles or trills they use, more than any other species.\n\nThe group says that while reaching more than 400 Vancouver Island marmots is a milestone, there is still a long way to go for their recovery.\n\nThe Marmot Recovery Foundation was founded in 1998 with the goal of saving the animals from extinction through captive breeding, reintroduction and habitat restoration.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 30, 2025.\n\nTo join the conversation set a first and last name in your user profile.\n\nSign in or register for free to join the Conversation\n\nError!

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\n\nCRANBROOK, BRITISH COLUMBIA - Cleanup work is underway after 12 rail cars of a Canadian Pacific Kansas City train derailed about 16 kilometres east of Cranbrook, B.C.\n\nCPKC said Saturday that the derailment occurred in a remote area of the Regional District of East Kootenay in southern B.C., and a preliminary assessment showed about 12 cars were involved, including some carrying wood products and three tanker cars carrying propane.\n\nCPKC says in an update Sunday that repairs to the track are finished and the corridor has reopened to railway traffic following safety inspections.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Parks says most rail cars involved in the incident contained non-dangerous goods, and it notes that lumber from one broken rail car entered the Kootenay River.\n\nIt says one propane tank car, located on land, had been reported to be leaking, and the railway says the propane cars, including the leaking one, were repositioned by a dangerous goods team on Sunday to be safely offloaded in the coming days.\n\nThe ministry says there were no fatalities or injuries reported from the derailment.\n\nThe railway company says the cause of the derailment is still under investigation.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 30, 2025.\n\nNote to readers:This is a corrected story. An earlier version omitted the railway’s update on a tanker car leaking propane\n\nTo join the conversation set a first and last name in your user profile.\n\nSign in or register for free to join the Conversation\n\nError!

    "content": "MONTREAL - A Quebec coroner is recommending strengthened measures to protect pedestrian safety after the hit-and-run death of a seven-year-old Ukrainian refugee in 2022.\n\nMONTREAL - A Quebec coroner is recommending strengthened measures to protect pedestrian safety after the hit-and-run death of a seven-year-old Ukrainian refugee in 2022.\n\nCoroner Éric Lépine said in a recent report that the girl’s death was accidental, caused by the driver’s failure to stop fully at an intersection as well as the blinding morning sun.\n\n“My analysis of the facts leads me to conclude that the driver never saw (the victim) and that (the victim) never saw the vehicle,” Lépine wrote. “The collision resulted from a lack of vigilance on the part of the driver, due to an incomplete stop of his vehicle combined with poor visibility caused by glare from the sun.”\n\nHowever, he called on the city and province to take steps to improve safety at intersections, including adding sun glare as a criteria to consider when deciding which measures to put in place.\n\nSeven-year-old Mariia Legenkovska was walking to school with her brother and sister on Dec. 13, 2022, when a Jeep Grand Cherokee fatally struck her. The driver drove away without stopping but turned himself in to police later that day.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in 2024 to failing to stop after an accident, and was later sentenced to a year of house arrest.\n\nMariia and her family moved to Montreal in 2022 to escape the Russian invasion of their country. Her father, Andrii Legenkovska, was fighting for Ukraine’s territorial defence forces when she was killed, and he travelled to Montreal from the front lines to bury his daughter.\n\nLépine’s Nov. 12 report redacts the victim’s name but notes that her death affected all of Quebec and prompted calls to better protect children in city streets.\n\nThe report notes that the driver slowed down and looked both ways at the intersection where the girl was struck, but did not stop. The driver did not see the girl, but felt a bump under his tires, it states. He turned himself in to police a few hours later.\n\nThe coroner noted that physical modifications such as bollards, speed bumps and curb extensions are the best way to improve pedestrian safety at intersections, and advised the city to continue adding them wherever possible.\n\nLépine also noted that sun glare at the intersection appeared to be a factor, and is particularly blinding during the winter months. Several witnesses, including police officers, told the coroner they were “completely blinded” by the sun on the street where the accident happened.\n\nLépine noted the intersection was not considered dangerous at the time of the accident, but that this could have been different if sun-related visibility had been on the list of criteria officials use to evaluate whether to bring in additional safety measures, such as crossing guards.\n\nThe coroner also noted that the driver had been directed by GPS to drive through a densely populated area — a route he’d never taken before — because of traffic stemming from the closure of two lanes of a major tunnel to the South Shore. He suggested that the province announced the construction work less than three months before it started, giving authorities little time to plan mitigation measures to manage traffic flow.\n\nHe suggested the province should announce its plans as early as possible, and should also work with companies that own GPS-related traffic apps to avoid sending too much traffic through residential streets.\n\nHe also asked the province to add sun glare to the list of criteria to consider when evaluating whether to place a crossing guard at an intersection.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 30, 2025.\n\nTo join the conversation set a first and last name in your user profile.\n\nSign in or register for free to join the Conversation\n\nError!

But it’s simply not\n\nIt’s heartening to see Ottawa and Alberta standing together, particularly at a time when Canada must present a common front. But it’s simply not\n\nBoth the Exxon Valdez and the more recent 2016 diesel spill from the sinking of the Nathan E. Stewart tugboat off B.C.‘s central coast have been invoked by First Nations and environmental groups opposed to the prospect of easing a ban on tanker traffic, to service a potential northern pipeline. So too has this month’s grounding of a container barge near Bella Bella.\n\nBut it is the consequences of the Exxon Valdez spill that Steiner said produced the kind of “hard lessons” that he said should be informing policy-makers — including that spills are not definitively preventable.\n\n“You don’t drive the risk of this thing to zero,” he said.\n\nAround midnight on March 24, 1989, the 300-metre-long supertanker struck a reef in Prince William Sound just off the Alaskan coast.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated 260,000 barrels of crude spilled into the sound; other groups estimated up to 760,000 barrels.\n\nHaunting images of seabirds coated in oil, the black slick lapping the once-pristine shores, have become visual shorthand for the consequences of a major spill.\n\nSteiner, now an environmental consultant, said the damage had become, to some extent, permanent.\n\n“There will never be full ecological recovery in Prince William Sound from this,” he said.\n\nSteiner saw the Exxon Valdez disaster as a cautionary tale for the Canadian government, and he warned against building a pipeline from Alberta to the northern coast and creating exceptions to the 53-year-old moratorium on tanker traffic on the B.C. north coast, which was formalized in legislation in 2019.\n\nAlberta and the federal government signed a memorandum of understanding for a northern pipeline on Thursday. Coastal First Nations swiftly declared it “would never happen,” and said the tanker ban was non-negotiable.\n\nSteiner, who taught at the University of Alaska at the time of the Exxon Valdez spill and helped lead the local response, said B.C.‘s northern coast already faced the prospect of a “catastrophic oil spill” from American tankers moving past Haida Gwaii.\n\nA pipeline terminal in northern B.C. with tankers shipping bitumen to distant markets in Asia would only add to that risk, and the Canadian government needed to ask itself whether “obliterating the socio-economic lives of people along the north coast of B.C. and southeast Alaska” would be worth the risk, he said.\n\n“The answer from my standpoint, would be to strongly advise the Canadian government against this,” he said. “This would be a fool’s errand.”\n\nSome industry groups, including the Chamber of Shipping, oppose the ban.\n\nIn 2017, it said in a submission to a Parliament committee that the tanker ban legislation was not supported by “tangible evidence” and that tanker safety had been improved by “new regulations, more robust ship design codes, enhanced emergency preparedness and response systems, and better self-regulation and procedures.”\n\n“Bill C-48 establishes a precedent in Canada for managing our national supply chain and is another layer of complexity on the already multi-faceted supply chain, thereby making Canada a more complex country in which to operate,” it said.\n\nSteiner acknowledged that the Exxon Valdez disaster and its aftermath led to several changes.\n\n“Yes, we have double-hulled tankers now,” he says. “We have tug escorts. We have better vessel tracking systems. We have piloting requirements and things like that.”\n\nBut he said those changes do not preclude another catastrophe.\n\n“It’s spectacularly dangerous to conceive of putting a pipeline to northern B.C. and hauling that oil across the Gulf of Alaska to Asian markets,” he said. “It should not see the light of day.”\n\nSteiner said the tanker ban on the north coast is the “safest thing” for “existing sustainable economies” in British Columbia.\n\nThis perspective echoed concerns of First Nations along the northern and central coast, such as the Heiltsuk Nation, which said in a statement last week that it was still recovering from the sinking of the Nathan E. Stewart nine years ago, which released about 110,000 litres of diesel oil.\n\n“Our cultural and harvesting areas have remained closed since then,” it said.\n\n“That was a spill under 700 barrels in size and polluted over 1,500 acres of our territory. In contrast, supertankers can carry (two) million barrels of oil. We cannot imagine and will never allow that kind of risk in our territory.”\n\nSteiner, who has worked with Coastal First Nations, said any spill of 1,000 barrels was considered catastrophic in his line of work.\n\nHe believed there would be revived attention for the Exxon Valdez disaster as talk of a northern pipeline continued.\n\n“Exxon Valdez does tend to get raised in any debate about transporting crude oil around the world … and rightfully so,” Steiner said.\n\nDavid Tindall, a professor of sociology at the University of British Columbia, said the disaster worked its way into North American culture because it “was very visual.”\n\n“So, there was an awful lot of imagery on TV and in documentaries, in newspapers and in magazines, and so on,” he said. “It was a really powerful thing at the time.”\n\nTindall said the spill also shaped the debate about since-abandoned plans for the Northern Gateway pipeline and the eventual expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline in B.C.\n\nTindall said familiarity with the Exxon Valdez had a generational component, and he was “not sure the average 25-year-old has Exxon Valdez on their mind.”\n\nBut the images of the spill had become familiar, he said. “When people see birds that are covered in oil, or they see rescue workers trying to clean up birds or seals, or other kinds of animals that live along the coast, that is a very big impact,” he said.\n\nSuch images would likely have a much bigger impact on the debate than technical details about how much more greenhouse gas emissions might be produced, he says.\n\nFirst Nations title and treaty rights would also shape the debate, and Tindall said he expected various groups opposed to the project to use whatever tools were available to them.\n\n“So, if they think that imagery and a PR campaign about the downsides of possible oil spills is going to work, then they will try that,” he said.\n\n“If that doesn’t seem to be working, then maybe, they pivot to court cases and kind of push on Indigenous rights. If that doesn’t work, maybe they will try some other kind of angle, something to do with the financial consequences of the project.”\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 30, 2025.\n\nTo join the conversation set a first and last name in your user profile.\n\nSign in or register for free to join the Conversation\n\nError!

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh\n\nCALGARY - Chaz Smith remembers being homeless, and the awful foreboding when the snow came, the temperatures plunged and the very drugs holding him in thrall became the rescue line keeping him alive.\n\n“Your immediate concern was obviously that it’s cold, you’re going to freeze and die outside when temperatures drop,” Smith, who is now an outreach worker, said in an interview.\n\nSmith, now 35, was a teen when he lived on Calgary’s streets. He said when the ice came, he and his friends became heat seekers — parkades, shopping malls, transit buses, train stations.\n\n“In your mind, you’re trying to figure out where all the warming spaces are that you can get in to,” he said. “When it’s that cold, it hits -20 C, -30 C, I did use substances in order to stay awake, wrapped myself in blankets, try and find heated parkades.”\n\nHe said the drug use – especially the stimulants – rises, “so people can stay awake and keep walking and keep moving because as soon as you stop, that’s when things get dire.”\n\nSmith is the founder of BeTheChangeYYC street outreach group, providing food, water, blankets, hygiene supplies, tents and tarps three nights a week in the city’s downtown.\n\nFor the 60,000 Canadians who are homeless, this is the start of the deadliest time of year.\n\nA point-in-time enumeration in 74 communities across Canada in 2024 found the number of the unhoused has nearly doubled over the past six years. More and more are living in unsheltered locations such as encampments.\n\nHealth Canada says between 2011 and 2023, there were almost 1,700 cold-related deaths in Canada — about 129 deaths per year. More than two-thirds were men.\n\nDuring that time, there were well over 9,000 cold-related hospitalizations.\n\n“The weather and everything else can be quite dangerous no matter what time of year, but winter gets especially challenging,” said Tim Richter, the president and CEO of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\n“It’s really horrific what happens in our community that people just don’t see. It’s an unnatural disaster because it’s not created by nature and is bigger and more expensive.”\n\nThe Calgary Homeless Foundation, the city of Calgary and more than 20 partner organizations started the annual extreme weather response. It provides seasonal day spaces, overnight transportation to emergency shelters and critical winter supplies.\n\nHelp during the day is critical, as those on the streets can stay in a shelter overnight, said Bo Masterson, with the Calgary Homeless Foundation. Masterson said the program is saving lives and many of the unhoused have registered and are waiting for housing.\n\nThere are similar programs in Winnipeg and Toronto, but Richter said it’s not enough.\n\n“Unless we get serious about providing deeply affordable housing quickly, we’re just going to continue pouring money into these emergency responses as the problem gets worse and worse,” he said.\n\nShaundra Bruvall is with Alpha House, which operates a shelter, detox housing and outreach programs. Bruvall said street teams try to build trust with clients and convince them to get shelter when it’s needed, helping those who don’t realize the cold could be making them their own worst enemy.\n\n“Where addiction is present, people don’t always know that they’re in danger,” Bruvall said. “Their bodies maybe aren’t showing the signs because of their intoxication levels, so hypothermia is a real risk — and it doesn’t even have to be that cold.”\n\nCalgary Mayor Jeromy Farkas said homelessness, crime, mental health and addiction is a nuanced and complex topic. He said the problem will continue to be monitored and it’s a conversation that needs to be held with the non-profit sector as well as the provincial government.\n\n“The city can’t go it alone on this one,” he told reporters last week. “I will strongly advocate for the city to do its part and for the province to step up, too.”\n\nBack at BeTheChangeYYC, Smith said, in the meantime, his organization will continue to help. They assisted more than 19,000 people last year.\n\nAnd for Smith, it’s personal.\n\n“I think the one fear I have is ever becoming homeless again,” he said.\n\n“That would terrify me.”\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 30, 2025.\n\nTo join the conversation set a first and last name in your user profile.\n\nSign in or register for free to join the Conversation\n\nError!

(AP Photo/Denis Poroy)\n\nSAN DIEGO - The Vancouver Whitecaps know their work is not done.\n\nThe team downed expansion side San Diego FC 3-1 to earn the title of Western Conference champions Saturday.\n\nEven as they raised the trophy in the air, confetti falling around them, the players were already turning their minds toward their next task: the MLS Cup final against Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami on Dec. 6.\n\n“Obviously winning the conference and getting a trophy is nice. And we’ll enjoy that,” said striker Brian White. “But the ultimate goal is to win an MLS Cup. And we know how hard that will be in Miami.”\n\nThe ‘Caps finished the regular season second in the West with an 18-7-9 record and eliminated FC Dallas and Los Angeles FC before taking on San Diego in Saturday’s conference final.\n\nVancouver was dominant from the outset, with White poking a ball from teammate Andres Cubas into the San Diego goal in the eighth minute.\n\nThe visitors doubled their lead in the 11th off an own goal by ‘keeper Pablo Sisniega.\n\nEmmanuel Sabbi collected a ball from Whitecaps superstar Thomas Muller and launched a shot, but Sisniega turned it away. The rebound popped out to Vancouver’s Ali Ahmed, who sent it flying back toward the net, where it pinged in off the netminder.\n\nAhmed set up another striker in the second minute of first-half injury time, slicing a ball across the six-yard box to White, who chested it in for his second goal of the night.\n\nVancouver took a 3-0 cushion into the locker room.\n\nVancouver Whitecaps defender Édier Ocampo (18) breaks away from San Diego FC defender Luca Bombino during the first half of an MLS Western Conference final soccer match, Saturday, Nov. 29, 2025, in San Diego. (AP Photo/Denis Poroy)\n\nSan Diego made a trio of changes out of the half in a bid to spark its offence, including bringing Mexican forward Hirving Lozano on for Corey Baird.\n\nThe move paid off in the 60th minute when Lozano lobbed a right-footed shot up and into the Vancouver net from above the penalty area, cutting his team’s deficit to 3-1.\n\nSan Diego’s bid for a comeback took a hit in the 79th minute when Sisniega was sent off after coming up out of the penalty area to challenge attacking midfielder Ryan Gauld. The ‘keeper sent Gauld flying and was quickly shown the red card, leaving the home side down a man for the rest of the game.\n\nWhile the two sides were even in shots across the match at 12-12, Vancouver had the better chances with an 8-4 edge in on-target chances.\n\n“We played with conviction in the way we wanted to play,” said Whitecaps head coach Jesper Sorensen. “And we played with pace on the ball but still with good movements and with some patience, so we didn’t attack too fast. We waited until the openings were there.\n\n“I think it was a great game from the players.”\n\nVancouver Whitecaps forward Brian White (24), center, is congratulated after scoring during the first half of an MLS Western Conference final soccer match against San Diego FC, Saturday, Nov. 29, 2025, in San Diego. (AP Photo/Denis Poroy)\n\nThe victory marks Vancouver’s first MLS conference title. Next week, the club will make its first appearance in the league’s championship game.\n\nThe Whitecaps know Saturday’s win was a big achievement, Muller said, but the team is staying level-headed.\n\n“The boys are calm,” he said. “We know that there’s one more step to go. And that’s a really good feeling, to be with them.”\n\nVancouver has already faced Miami twice this year, taking a pair of wins to advance to the CONCACAF Champions Cup final, where the ‘Caps ultimately fell to LIGA MX side Cruz Azul.\n\nNext week’s battle at Chase Stadium will feature a matchup of global superstars. Miami has Messi, while Vancouver’s Muller is a German soccer legend.\n\nDespite the big names, the game will be about more than two players, Muller said.\n\n“It’s not about Messi against Thomas Muller. It’s about Miami against the Whitecaps,” said the star attacking midfielder. “Maybe they rely a little bit more on him than we do on me because we are such a good group.”\n\nThe Whitecaps have lost just once since Muller joined the team in mid-August.\n\n“Since August, it’s like a Cinderella story. And I try to keep on dancing,” he said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 29, 2025.\n\nError!

Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday said he’s invited the family of a National Guard member fatally shot last week to the White House , saying he spoke to her parents and they were “devastated.”\n\nU.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died after the Wednesday shooting in Washington, D.C., while her seriously injured colleague, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remained in critical condition.\n\nThe president said he’s discussed a White House visit for the parents of both members of the West Virginia National Guard.\n\n“I said, ‘When you’re ready, because that’s a tough thing, come to the White House. We’re going to honor Sarah,” Trump told reporters. “And likewise with Andrew, recover or not.”\n\nIn recent days, local vigils in West Virginia have honored the soldiers, including one Saturday evening at Webster County High School, where Beckstrom attended classes.\n\n“Sarah was the kind of student that teachers hoped for, she carried herself with quiet strength, a contagious smile and a positive energy that lifted people around her,” said Gabriel Markle, the school’s principal. “She was sweet, caring and always willing to help others.”\n\nBeckstrom, 20, and Wolfe, 24 were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard as part of Trump’s aggressive crime-fighting plan that federalized the D.C. police force.\n\nA 29-year-old Afghan national faces one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed in the shooting, which prompted the Trump administration to halt all asylum decisions and pause issuing visas for people traveling on Afghan passports.\n\nFuneral arrangements had not been finalized for Beckstrom, according to Cathy Pettry, the owner of Dodd & Reed Funeral Home in Webster Springs. Pettry said Saturday the home has been in contact with Beckstrom’s family about services.\n\nThe hometown crowd, seated in bleachers and folding chairs, lit candles as they heard from clergy and Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who said he had visited Wolfe’s family earlier in the day.\n\nWolfe, of Martinsburg, entered service in February 2019. He had graduated from Musselman High School in 2019, according to Berkeley County Schools.\n\nHe remained hospitalized and “fighting for his life,” Morrisey said the following day during an interview with Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing.”\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told “Fox News Sunday” that she also planned to meet with Wolfe’s family.\n\nMorrisey called it a challenging time for the state.\n\nCalling Beckstrom a “favorite daughter of Webster County,” he said he quickly learned about her reputation as someone with a big heart who loved to serve others. Beckstrom, of Summersville, graduated in June 2023 and enlisted that month. She served with distinction as a military police officer, according to the West Virginia National Guard.\n\n“She had a lot of kindness and she certainly had courage,” Morrisey told the crowd during Saturday’s vigil. “Though her life lasted far too short, she has left a mark that’s going to last forever.”\n\n— AP writer Josh Boak contributed from West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

    "content": "Instructions:\n\nWant to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.\n\nIf you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nWhile Alberta and the federal government have struck a pact to lay the groundwork for a pipeline to the B.C. coast, Indigenous nations in Alberta remain mixed in their reception, even as one group has been named a key partner.\n\nThe Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation was named a key partner in Ottawa and Alberta’s memorandum of understanding last week.\n\nChanna Martineau with the AIOC says it’s a first step.\n\n“This is an opportunity to start with the way you mean to go on,” she said.\n\nThe memorandum says Ottawa’s approval of the pipeline would be based on whether the project is seen as being in the national interest and “provides opportunities for Indigenous co-ownership and shared economic benefits.”\n\nTo date, the corporation has helped provide approximately $745 million in loan guarantees to projects affecting 43 First Nations.\n\nBut it’s not without difficulty, as the pipeline is unlikely to go ahead without sign-off from Alberta and British Columbia’s First Nations. And Martineau worries that consultation is often done too late.\n\n“A lot of it (consultation) happens after a lot of the design work has been done,” said Martineau.\n\n“Where you want that Indigenous participation is at the very beginning. I always say those conversations might be hard, they’re not easy conversations, but you’re better to have them up front than to get mired in quagmire when you’ve already invested in a project that isn’t workable from an Indigenous perspective.”\n\nThough the AIOC is involved, some First Nations are concerned about the project, including the Confederacy of Treaty 6 First Nations.\n\nOn Friday, the Confederacy said it expects collaboration with both Ottawa and Alberta to discuss future economic opportunities, but is “disappointed” it was not included at the decision-making table.\n\n“We require a seat at any table where decisions are made that impact our People,” the Confederacy said in a statement.\n\nThe Confederacy’s treaty covers much of a likely pipeline route.\n\nThe proposal in the MOU is aimed at establishing a bitumen pipeline from Alberta to the West Coast and would carry an additional 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day destined for Asian markets.\n\nThe MOU also notes that there could be an “appropriate adjustment to the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, ” if necessary.\n\nThe act, often referred to as a tanker “ban,” was first introduced by the federal Liberal government in 2017 and became law two years later. It prevents tankers carrying more than 12,500 metric tonnes of oil from docking on B.C.’s North Coast. The affected area stretches from the northern tip of Vancouver Island to the Alaska border, and encompasses the archipelago of Haida Gwaii.\n\nThen-transport minister Marc Garneau, who sponsored the bill, defended it at the time by citing the “navigational hazards” of the region, which he said would make responding to an oil spill more challenging.\n\nA potential oil spill remains a concern, especially as the groundwork is laid for this potential pipeline, with the Exxon Valdez as one such disaster on the mind of Rick Steiner.\n\nSteiner was one of the first on scene of the disaster and has studied its aftermath closely.\n\n“It’s a very ill-conceived proposal,” said Steiner in an interview. “It w0uld be the wrong choice by the Canadian government. No matter how safe you make a tanker terminal and an export of crude oil, which is a very hazardous chemical substance via tankers, no matter how safe you make it, there is still risk of a catastrophic grounding or collision or oil spill.”\n\nAn estimated 260,000 barrels of crude spilled into the Prince William Sound off the Alaska coast, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, though some groups estimated as many as 760,000 barrels spilled.\n\nFor a future bitumen pipeline to get an export facility, it would require an exemption from the tanker ban or a boundary change to allow oil tankers through the Dixon Entrance to carry oil to Asia.\n\nIn a statement, Coastal First Nations in B.C. have made it clear an exemption is not an option.\n\n“I do understand that their trepidation as well and part of my job – what the premier has entrusted me to do – is to make sure that I’m having really authentic, open and transparent conversations,” said Alberta Minister of Indigenous Relations Rajan Sawhney.\n\nMartineau, a member of Frog Lake First Nation within Treaty 6, says industry and Indigenous groups need to modernize their relationships, saying each may hold a differing viewpoint.\n\n“Many in corporate Canada, I think, have a view of the stand-off First Nations person in warpaint with a sign,” she said. “First Nations often still have a view of the energy companies that might be anchored in the 80s and 90s about a Lorax-type situation.”\n\nSawhney said a recent meeting with Chief Kelsey Jacko of Cold Lake First Nation was “productive.”\n\n“I had the opportunity to listen to his concerns and we had agreed that we are going to walk this path together,” Sawhney said.\n\nAs of Sunday, there has been no industry partners expressing interest in the potential project.\n\n— with files from Global News’ Sean Boynton, Uday Rana, Drew Stremick and The Canadian Press\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

    "content": "Instructions:\n\nWant to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.\n\nIf you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nOver nearly a decade of football, Seth Hundeby and Daniel Wiebe have suited up alongside each other the entire way.\n\nFrom representing the province on Team Saskatchewan, to competing together at Holy Cross High School in Saskatoon, to moving on to the University of Saskatchewan Huskies football program, the duo have been nearly inseparable.\n\nFitting then, the pair inked contracts with the CFL’s Saskatchewan Roughriders on back-to-back days following the conclusion of their U Sports careers this past week.\n\n“To be with the Riders growing up in Saskatchewan… if you would have told 11-year-old Seth that was a possibility he would have lost his mind,” Hundeby said. “I’m just in awe of the moment and super excited to be with that organization, especially because they’ve been so successful and have such a good team culture. It’s really amazing.”\n\nHundeby, who was recently won the President’s Trophy for U Sports Defensive Player of the Year, is coming off a memorable final season with the Huskies where he led the defence as captain at his linebacker position.\n\nDrafted in the fourth round, 34th overall last spring by the Roughriders, Hundeby chose to return for a fifth and final season with the Huskies as well as complete his engineering degree —a pursuit he said was fully supported by the CFL club.\n\n“I really value my engineering and it’s definitely something to have in the back pocket,” said Hundeby. “Football, it doesn’t matter how much you love it, it doesn’t always love you and it will say that you will have a last snap at some point or another. The fact they allowed me to do that, they were understanding, they were good about it and they encouraged it… It means a lot to me.”\n\nAs for Wiebe, his professional contract comes after being selected with Saskatchewan’s final pick of the 2025 CFL Draft in the eighth round.\n\nAttending Roughriders training camp last season alongside Hundeby, Wiebe said it’s a good feeling knowing he’ll be back on the field at Griffiths Stadium next spring with a professional contract in hand.\n\n“It’s a dream come true to have that opportunity again and I just want to go and make the most of it,” said Wiebe. “I’m super excited to go back in May and make the most of that opportunity. I’m grateful for it and it means a lot to be able to be there again.”\n\nWiebe capped off his 2025 season with one of the most dominant campaigns in recent memory by a Canada West receiver, taking home the conference’s Player of the Year award after posting 1,257 yards and 13 touchdowns. He was also nominated for the Hec Crighton Award for U Sports Most Valuable Player.\n\nEven though he also broke the Huskies’ single-season and all-time touchdown reception records, Weibe said it’s going to be a big jump heading to the pro ranks next year. But it’s a move he feels ready to make after five standout seasons with the Huskies program.\n\n“It’s going to be a big jump and it’s going to be a big challenge,” said Wiebe. “That’s going to take it’s own approach to be willing to experience that, so when that comes I just got to be ready for another challenge. I’m happy to have that opportunity to be challenged. So, once camp comes just be ready to experience all that and everything that comes along with it.”\n\nThe contract signings come just days after the Huskies suffered a heartbreaking 30-16 loss in the 2025 Vanier Cup in Regina, with both Hundeby and Wiebe closing out their collegiate careers one win shy of a national championship.\n\nFor Hundeby, the days following have resulted in plenty of reflection while also healing up from a physically demanding season.\n\n“We had a meeting just the other day,” said Hundeby. “As much as it is tough that we lost, it’s still the guys. We’re still having fun and we’re joking around, so it was nice to see them. I’ve been doing a lot more school, but just enjoying a bit of time off. I’m letting the body not get in that many car-crashes per, say, per week as it has been for the last 12 weeks.”\n\nSharing a final few days with his teammates after the Vanier Cup defeat, Wiebe believes the team pushed as hard as they could while overcoming injury and adversity throughout his senior year.\n\n“I still honestly haven’t processed too, too much,” said Wiebe. “It’s been a crazy last month or so, it’s been a lot. Overall, I’m just proud of the guys and really happy I was on this team this year. I’m just proud of the guys and everything we’ve been through.”\n\nSporting an ankle boot on his foot following a case of turf-toe during the Huskies’ post-season run, the next goal for Wiebe is to get healthy in time for Roughriders training camp in May as the team looks to defend their Grey Cup championship in 2026.\n\n“Obviously, I got some lingering issues from the season,” said Wiebe. “Getting the turf-toe right, that’s kind of priority number one. Beyond that, I just got to get bigger, faster, stronger. Every single off-season that’s really the goal, just got to keep working on that. Get the toe right, get the body right and be at peak performance for camp.”\n\nBoth Wiebe and Hundeby will be back at their old stomping grounds of Griffiths Stadium next spring, not only for training camp but also a Roughriders pre-season game in Saskatoon for the first time since 1991.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nA Quebec coroner is recommending strengthened measures to protect pedestrian safety after the hit-and-run death of a seven-year-old Ukrainian refugee in 2022.\n\nCoroner Éric Lépine said in a recent report that the girl’s death was accidental, caused by the driver’s failure to stop fully at an intersection as well as the blinding morning sun.\n\n“My analysis of the facts leads me to conclude that the driver never saw (the victim) and that (the victim) never saw the vehicle,” Lépine wrote. “The collision resulted from a lack of vigilance on the part of the driver, due to an incomplete stop of his vehicle combined with poor visibility caused by glare from the sun.”\n\nHowever, he called on the city and province to take steps to improve safety at intersections, including adding sun glare as a criteria to consider when deciding which measures to put in place.\n\nSeven-year-old Mariia Legenkovska was walking to school with her brother and sister on Dec. 13, 2022, when a Jeep Grand Cherokee fatally struck her. The driver drove away without stopping but turned himself in to police later that day.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in 2024 to failing to stop after an accident, and was later sentenced to a year of house arrest.\n\nMariia and her family moved to Montreal in 2022 to escape the Russian invasion of their country. Her father, Andrii Legenkovska, was fighting for Ukraine’s territorial defence forces when she was killed, and he travelled to Montreal from the front lines to bury his daughter.\n\nLépine’s Nov. 12 report redacts the victim’s name but notes that her death affected all of Quebec and prompted calls to better protect children in city streets.\n\nThe report notes that the driver slowed down and looked both ways at the intersection where the girl was struck, but did not stop. The driver did not see the girl, but felt a bump under his tires, it states. He turned himself in to police a few hours later.\n\nThe coroner noted that physical modifications such as bollards, speed bumps and curb extensions are the best way to improve pedestrian safety at intersections, and advised the city to continue adding them wherever possible.\n\nLépine also noted that sun glare at the intersection appeared to be a factor, and is particularly blinding during the winter months. Several witnesses, including police officers, told the coroner they were “completely blinded” by the sun on the street where the accident happened.\n\nLépine noted the intersection was not considered dangerous at the time of the accident, but that this could have been different if sun-related visibility had been on the list of criteria officials use to evaluate whether to bring in additional safety measures, such as crossing guards.\n\nThe coroner also noted that the driver had been directed by GPS to drive through a densely populated area — a route he’d never taken before — because of traffic stemming from the closure of two lanes of a major tunnel to the South Shore. He suggested that the province announced the construction work less than three months before it started, giving authorities little time to plan mitigation measures to manage traffic flow.\n\nHe suggested the province should announce its plans as early as possible, and should also work with companies that own GPS-related traffic apps to avoid sending too much traffic through residential streets.\n\nHe also asked the province to add sun glare to the list of criteria to consider when evaluating whether to place a crossing guard at an intersection.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nWith Black Friday behind them and Cyber Monday underway, Canadian shoppers are looking for deals, but they’re buying differently this year.\n\nJeff Doucette of Field Agent Canada told Global News that demand for promotions remains strong.\n\n“Ninety per cent of Canadians were looking to purchase and get some deals during Black Friday or right through to the Cyber Monday weekend,” he said. “People are actually taking advantage of Black Friday deals to buy things like laundry detergent and just things that they use in their house every day.”\n\nEven with sales, shoppers say budgets remain tight. The average Canadian plans to spend less than $500 on gifts this year.\n\n“Their salaries haven’t necessarily gone up,” said Doucette. “They don’t have more money to spend just because things are more expensive, so they’re being smarter.”\n\nBusinesses are feeling the shift as well. Calgary wine shop owner Nathalie Gosselin told Global News that stores are working harder to close sales.\n\n“A lot more events, a lot more tastings… we’re working twice as hard for a very small amount of growth,” she said.\n\nWhile Canada’s GDP grew 0.6 per cent in the third quarter , unemployment remains high at 7.8 per cent. That economic pressure has many shoppers thinking more about meaning than price.\n\n“I used to buy lavish gifts,” said Calgary shopper Carla Little, “but I think that you really have to get smart about how you spend your money.”\n\nOthers maintain the best gifts are handmade.\n\n“I try to put some personal touches: I make Christmas cards, for example, handmade,” said shopper Rod Zillman.\n\nAnother Calgarian, Kaitlyn Burke, agrees, telling Global News, “Arts, crafts… just making it. I think it’s the effort.”\n\nGosselin said many customers are also choosing to support independent retailers during the holiday rush. “They are very conscientious to make sure that they support local, and that they support us specifically to make sure that we stay in business.”\n\nNew research from the Boston Consulting Group shows nearly half of Canadians feel less financially secure than they did a year ago, and one in three households say they wouldn’t be able to cover their monthly expenses if their income stopped.\n\nBCG Canada head Kathleen Polsonello told Global News that shoppers are leaning toward essential purchases and Canadian-made products. She also said about 40 per cent of Canadians have used or plan to use AI tools to compare prices and product specifications. Among Gen Z and Millennials, that figure rises to 50 per cent.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

As temperature temperatures plunged, the very drugs holding him in thrall became the rescue line keeping him alive.\n\n“Your immediate concern was obviously that it’s cold. You’re going to freeze and die outside when temperatures drop,” Smith, now an outreach worker, said in an interview.\n\n“In your mind, you’re trying to figure out where all the warming spaces are that you can get in to… When it’s that cold, it hits -20 C, -30 C, I did use substances in order to stay awake, wrapped myself in blankets, try and find heated parkades.”\n\nSmith, now 35, was a teen when he lived on Calgary’s streets. He said when the ice came, he and his friends became heat seekers — parkades, shopping malls, transit buses, train stations.\n\nIn these circumstance, drug use – especially the stimulants – rises, “so people can stay awake and keep walking and keep moving because as soon as you stop, that’s when things get dire.”\n\nSmith is the founder of BeTheChangeYYC outreach group, providing food, water, blankets, hygiene supplies, tents and tarps three nights a week in the city’s downtown.\n\nFor the 60,000 Canadians who are homeless, this is the start of the deadliest time of year.\n\nA point-in-time enumeration in 74 communities across Canada in 2024 found the number of the unhoused has nearly doubled over the past six years. More and more are living in unsheltered locations, such as encampments.\n\nHealth Canada says between 2011 and 2023, there were almost 1,700 cold-related deaths in Canada — about 129 deaths per year. More than two-thirds were men.\n\nDuring that time, there were also well over 9,000 cold-related hospitalizations.\n\n“The weather and everything else can be quite dangerous no matter what time of year, but winter gets especially challenging,” said Tim Richter, the president and CEO of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\n“It’s really horrific what happens in our community that people just don’t see. It’s an unnatural disaster because it’s not created by nature and is bigger and more expensive.”\n\nThe Calgary Homeless Foundation, the City of Calgary and more than 20 partner organizations started the annual extreme weather response in 2022. It provides seasonal day spaces, overnight transportation to emergency shelters and critical winter supplies.\n\nHelp during the day is critical, as those on the streets can stay in a shelter overnight, said Bo Masterson, with the Calgary Homeless Foundation. Masterson said the program is saving lives and many of the unhoused have registered and are waiting for housing.\n\nThere are similar programs in Winnipeg and Toronto, but Richter said it’s not enough.\n\n“Unless we get serious about providing deeply affordable housing quickly, we’re just going to continue pouring money into these emergency responses as the problem gets worse and worse,” he said.\n\nShaundra Bruvall is with Alpha House, which operates a shelter, detox housing and outreach programs. Bruvall said street teams try to build trust with clients and convince them to get shelter when it’s needed, helping those who don’t realize the cold could be making them their own worst enemy.\n\n“Where addiction is present, people don’t always know that they’re in danger,” Bruvall said. “Their bodies maybe aren’t showing the signs because of their intoxication levels, so hypothermia is a real risk — and it doesn’t even have to be that cold.”\n\nCalgary Mayor Jeromy Farkas said homelessness, crime, mental health and addiction is a nuanced and complex topic. He said the problem will continue to be monitored and it’s a conversation that needs to be held with the non-profit sector as well as the provincial government.\n\n“The city can’t go it alone on this one,” he told reporters last week. “I will strongly advocate for the city to do its part and for the province to step up, too.”\n\nBack at BeTheChangeYYC, Smith said his organization will continue to help in the meantime. They assisted more than 19,000 people last year.\n\nAnd for Smith, it’s personal.\n\n“I think the one fear I have is ever becoming homeless again,” he said.\n\n“That would terrify me.”\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nTop Trump administration officials met with Ukrainian negotiators in Florida on Sunday, pushing to broker an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine and setting the stage for key talks planned this week in Moscow with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, held talks with a Ukrainian delegation to further hash out the details of a proposed peace framework. The negotiations come at a sensitive moment for Ukraine as it continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a domestic corruption scandal.\n\nDiplomats have been focused on revisions to a proposed 28-point plan developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.\n\n“The end goal, obviously, is not just the end of the war,” Rubio said in brief remarks. “But it’s also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.”\n\n“This is not just about peace deals,” the top American diplomat said as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach.\n\nRustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s security council, responded to Rubio by expressing his country’s appreciation for U.S. efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has at times claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for U.S. assistance during the war.\n\n“U.S. is hearing us,” Umerov said. “U.S. is supporting us. U.S. is working beside us.”\n\nUmerov has been involved in ongoing talks. But until now, Ukraine’s head negotiator had been Andrii Yermak, the powerful chief of staff of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators.\n\nZelenskyy’s government has been roiled by fallout from a scandal over $100 million embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy.\n\nIt was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan.\n\nAmong the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz.\n\nThe plan, which Trump has since played down as a “concept” or a “map” to be “fine-tuned,” would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine’s military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it’s not clear how its provisions have been altered.\n\nIt had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia — a sticking point for Kyiv.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and perhaps Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments published Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin departs for India.\n\nBoth Witkoff and Kushner, like Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nZelenskyy wrote on X that the Ukrainian delegation would “swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war.”\n\nIn his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was “demonstrating a constructive approach.”\n\n“In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,” he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Russian drone and missile attacks in and around Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, killed at least three people and wounded dozens more, officials said. Fresh attacks overnight into Sunday killed one person and wounded 19 others, including four children, local officials said, when a drone hit a nine-story apartment block in the city of Vyshhorod in the Kyiv region.\n\nIn a post on Telegram Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had attacked Ukraine with 122 strike drones and ballistic missiles.\n\n“Such attacks occur daily. This week alone, Russians have used nearly 1,400 strike drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs and 66 missiles against our people. That is why we must strengthen Ukraine’s resilience every day. Missiles and air defense systems are necessary, and we must also actively work with our partners for peace,” Zelenskyy said.\n\n“We need real, reliable solutions that will help end the war,” he said.\n\nAfter Ukraine claimed responsibility for damaging a major oil terminal on Saturday near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, owned by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Kazakhstan told Ukraine on Sunday to stop attacking the Black Sea terminal. The CPC pipeline, which starts in Kazakhstan and ends at the Novorossisyk terminal, handles a large proportion of Kazakhstan’s oil exports.\n\n“We view what has occurred as an action harming the bilateral relations of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and we expect the Ukrainian side to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future,” Kazakhstan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\n— Associated Press writer Elise Morton in London contributed to this report.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",

    "content": "Instructions:\n\nWant to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.\n\nIf you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us .\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith is vowing to keep up the fight against Ottawa as she admits many of her United Conservative Party members still need to be convinced that her recent pipeline pact is indeed a victory.\n\nThe milestone deal with Ottawa signed earlier this week clears regulatory hurdles for a potential pipeline to the West Coast.\n\nWhen her party’s annual convention opened Friday, the premier was met with skepticism and, at one point, boos when she asked party supporters whether they felt more confident in Canada than before the pact with Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nOn Saturday, Smith encouraged some 4,500 party members to “take the win” and see the accord as a starting point, but she also vowed her government would “double down” on its battle with Ottawa.\n\n“Alberta is winning and we will continue to win this battle for our freedom and provincial rights – because we are on the right side of history,” she said.\n\nSmith, as an example of her willingness to fight, promised to introduce a motion in the legislature next week that, if passed, would see the province refuse to enforce or prosecute the federal gun buy back program.\n\nThe motion would come under Smith’s flagship Alberta Sovereignty Within A United Canada Act — a law that purports to allow the province to sidestep federal laws.\n\nSmith said a motion would also stop municipalities and law enforcement from prosecuting Albertans defending their homes and families from intruders.\n\nWhen pressed for details, she said they would come Monday.\n\nShe said the federal government must earn back the trust of Albertans as the benefits of the pipeline deal come to fruition.\n\nShe got warm approval when she listed its highlights, including a promise to abandon a federal emissions cap and net-zero power regulations.\n\nBut separatist sentiment was strong and vocal at the convention, something Smith alluded to in her speech.\n\nShe acknowledged many in the room will still feel angry with Ottawa because “we have been abused” in the past, but pushed for national unity.\n\n“My friends, let us not throw in the towel and give up on our country just as the battle has turned in our favour and victory is in sight,” she said to a mix of applause, cheers, heckles and boos.\n\n“Let us lower our fists, and instead, roll up our sleeves, and get to work on making our province and our people more prosperous than ever before.”\n\nSmith and her party faithful gleefully celebrated Steven Guilbeault’s resignation from federal cabinet over the pipeline deal. He for years spearheaded environmental initiatives that many in Alberta loathed.\n\n“On behalf of all Albertans, Mr. Guilbeault, we bid you adieu!” Smith said to raucous applause.\n\nDown the hall, one conservative media outlet’s kiosk displayed a cardboard cut-out of Guilbeault.\n\nNear the entrance to the event hall, attendees could have their picture taken with a cardboard cutout of the premier.\n\nDelegates cheered on her goals to take more control of immigration policy, reform health care, mandate addiction treatment, protect free speech for regulated professionals and her government’s laws affecting transgender people.\n\nThe crowd was larger, and seemingly more onside with her than the day before, something Smith noted to reporters after her speech Saturday.\n\nShe added she’s hearing enthusiasm from the business community, and Albertans will soon see an improved investment climate because of the deal with Carney.\n\n“It is brand new. People want to see action to be able to believe it,” she said, noting that repealed regulations alone make it a “huge victory” for the province.\n\n“People need a little bit of time to to see that it’s real.”\n\nWhen Smith wasn’t on the stage, delegates agreed to party policy restricting membership only to Canadian citizens. Members also endorsed dozens of new proposals for the government.\n\nThose included reintroducing coal-powered electricity to Alberta’s grid, only allowing government flags to be flown on public property, ending the practice of adding fluoride to water, and forcing temporary residents to pay for health care.\n\nSmith, speaking to reporters about a resolution to oppose federal regulation of industrial carbon emissions, said resolutions from members indicate what they believe the government should do.\n\n“When they give us direction, we look to see what is possible,” she said.\n\nShe added that with the Supreme Court of Canada ruling the federal government has jurisdiction over emissions, Alberta doesn’t have the flexibility to push back.\n\nHer UCP government isn’t bound by the recommendations, but some previous grassroots resolutions have become law during Smith’s tenure.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\n\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.",
